## 🎯 Collateral Factor Table

Credit scores map to collateral requirements as designed:

| Credit Score | Collateral Factor | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 900+ | 50% | Borrow $100 with $50 |
| 800-899 | 60% | Borrow $100 with $60 |
| 700-799 | 75% | Borrow $100 with $75 |
| 600-699 | 90% | Borrow $100 with $90 |
| 500-599 | 100% | Borrow $100 with $100 |
| 400-499 | 110% | Borrow $100 with $110 |
| 300-399 | 125% | Borrow $100 with $125 |
| <300 | 150% | Borrow $100 with $150 |

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

All prerequisites for deployment are met:

- ✅ Contracts compiled successfully
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Hardhat configured for Moca Devnet
- ✅ Deployment scripts ready
- ✅ Documentation complete

## 📋 Next Steps (Phase 2: Backend Services)

With Phase 1 complete, you can now:

1. **Deploy to Moca Devnet**:
   ```bash
   # 1. Get test MOCA from faucet
   # https://devnet-scan.mocachain.org/faucet
   
   # 2. Add DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY to .env
   # 3. Generate issuer wallets
   npm run setup-issuers
   
   # 4. Deploy contracts
   npm run deploy:devnet
   ```

2. **Move to Phase 2**: Backend Services & Credential Issuers
   - Create mock issuer service (Node.js/Express)
   - Implement credential signing
   - Set up API endpoints
   - Integrate with deployed contracts

3. **Move to Phase 3**: Frontend Development
   - Use deployed contract addresses
   - Integrate AIR Kit
   - Build dApp UI with shadcn/ui
