## 📊 Project Status & Maturity

**Current Status: Devnet Demo (Wave 3)**

✅ **What This Project IS:**
- Feature-complete devnet demonstration
- Official MOCA ecosystem integration
- Comprehensive smart contract testing (104+ tests passing)
- Professional UI/UX for showcasing
- Fully functional on Moca Devnet
- Great for hackathons and proof-of-concept

⚠️ **What This Project is NOT (Yet):**
- Using real financial data (still simulated credentials)
- Economically secure (no liquidation mechanism, price oracles needed)
- Battle-tested with real liquidity
- Regulatory compliant

**To Become Production-Ready, Would Need:**
1. Professional smart contract audit ($15k-50k)
2. Real credential integrations (Plaid, Experian, etc.)
3. Liquidation mechanism with keeper network
4. Price oracles for collateral valuation
5. Insurance fund for protocol solvency
6. Legal/compliance review
7. Gradual mainnet rollout with caps

**Current Best Use:** Educational demo, hackathon showcase, testnet experimentation

## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Finance (TradFi)
Credit systems are **opaque, centralized, and exclusionary**. Billions of people are locked out of capital markets due to lack of formal credit history.

### Current DeFi
While open and permissionless, DeFi lending is **capital-inefficient**. Protocols like Aave require **150% collateral** to borrow $100, making them unsuitable for genuine credit needs.

### Our Solution
Credo Protocol bridges this gap by creating an **identity-backed lending model**. Instead of relying solely on collateral, we assess creditworthiness based on verifiable on-chain and off-chain reputation.

### Key Innovation

**Traditional DeFi**: Borrow $100 → Need $150 collateral  
**Credo Protocol**: Borrow $100 → Need $50-$150 collateral (based on your credit score)

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **🔐 Seamless Login** - One-click Web3 SSO via Moca AIR Kit (Google/Email/Wallet)
- **🎫 Verifiable Credentials** - Privacy-preserving bucketed credentials via official AIR Kit
- **📊 On-Chain Credit Scoring** - Transparent 0-1000 scale with diversity bonuses
- **⚡ Dynamic Collateral** - 50-150% requirements based on your score
- **💰 Complete Lending Flow** - Supply, borrow, and repay USDC with real-time interest
- **🎁 Rewards System** - $50 USDC instant reward for employment verification
- **📈 Score Builder** - Interactive wizard with real-time simulation
- **🏆 Leaderboard** - Top credit scores across the network

### Why Credo Protocol?

**For Users:**
- 🎯 Borrow **2x-3x more** with the same collateral compared to Aave/Compound
- 🔒 Keep your data **private** - prove creditworthiness without revealing sensitive information
- 🌍 Access DeFi **without crypto wealth** - your real-world reputation matters
- 📈 Build **portable credit history** that works across all dApps

**For the Moca Ecosystem:**
- 🚀 **Killer App** for Moca ID adoption (requires Moca login)
- 🛠️ **AIR Kit Showcase** - demonstrates both Account + Credential Services
- 🧱 **Composable Primitive** - other dApps can use Credo credit scores
- 💡 **Web3 Innovation** - shifts DeFi from "how much you have" to "who you are"

**For DeFi:**
- 💰 Unlocks **trillions in capital** currently locked due to over-collateralization
- 🌊 Brings **real-world identity** to on-chain finance
- 🔗 Creates **interoperability** between TradFi credentials and DeFi protocols
- 🎪 Enables **new primitives** (credit-gated DAOs, reputation-based insurance, etc.)

## 📋 How It Works

```
1. Login with Moca ID (Google/Email/Wallet)
   ↓
2. Request Verifiable Credentials (CEX, Employer, Bank)
   ↓
3. Submit Credentials → Build Credit Score On-Chain
   ↓
4. Supply USDC as Collateral
   ↓
5. Borrow with Personalized Terms (Score-Based)
```

### Example User Journey

**Alice's Story**:
1. Logs in with her Google account via Moca AIR Kit ✅
2. Submits 3 credentials: CEX history, Employment proof, Stable balance ✅
3. Credit score calculated: **862/1000** ✅
4. Supplies $1,000 USDC as collateral ✅
5. **Can borrow up to $1,667 USDC** (60% collateral requirement) vs $667 in traditional DeFi 🎉

## 💎 Credit Scoring System

### Collateral Requirements by Score

| Credit Score | Collateral Required | Borrowing Power (per $100 collateral) |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 900-1000     | 50%                 | $200                                   |
| 800-899      | 60%                 | $167                                   |
| 700-799      | 75%                 | $133                                   |
| 600-699      | 90%                 | $111                                   |
| 500-599      | 100%                | $100                                   |
| 400-499      | 110%                | $91                                    |
| 300-399      | 125%                | $80                                    |
| 0-299        | 150%                | $67 (Standard DeFi)                    |

### Score Calculation

```javascript
Base Score: 500

+ Credential Type Weights:
  • Proof of Stable Balance: +100 points
  • Proof of CEX History: +80 points
  • Proof of Employment: +70 points

× Issuer Trust Score: 0-100%
× Recency Decay: 70-100% (based on credential age)

+ Diversity Bonus: 5% per unique credential type (up to 25%)

= Final Score (0-1000, capped)
```

**Example**:
- 3 credentials (CEX + Employment + Bank Balance)
- Full issuer trust (100%)
- Recent submissions (100% recency)
- Calculation: (500 + 80 + 70 + 100) × 1.15 = **862**

### 🚀 Future Roadmap (Post-Wave 3)

**Wave 3 Complete!** Here's what's next for Credo Protocol:

#### Wave 4+ Features:
- 🔜 **Real-World Data Integration** - Plaid API for verified bank balance proofs
- 🔜 **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Full ZK implementation via AIR Credential Services
  - Prove "income > $X" without revealing exact salary
  - Prove "balance stable for Y months" without exposing amounts
- 🔜 **Gas Sponsorship Activation** - Enable paymaster for gasless credential issuance
- 🔜 **Additional Reward Tiers** - Multiple verification rewards (Credit Score Champion, Whale Supplier)
- 🔜 **Liquidation Mechanism** - Automated liquidations with keeper incentives
- 🔜 **Issuer SDK v1.0** - Open framework for third-party credential providers
- 🔜 **Advanced Analytics** - Historical credit score tracking & trend analysis
- 🔜 **Cross-Chain Identity** - Use MOCA Identity Oracle for multi-chain verification
- 🔜 **Governance Token** - Community-driven protocol governance
- 🔜 **Additional Credential Types** - Education, healthcare, on-chain activity

**Note:** Wave 3 transformed Credo from a basic MVP into a feature-complete devnet demo with official MOCA integration, privacy-preserving credentials, and ecosystem composability. While not yet mainnet-ready, it demonstrates all core concepts and is fully functional for testing.
