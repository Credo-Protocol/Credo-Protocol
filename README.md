## 🎯 The Problem We're Solving

### Traditional Finance (TradFi)
Credit systems are **opaque, centralized, and exclusionary**. Billions of people are locked out of capital markets due to lack of formal credit history.

### Current DeFi
While open and permissionless, DeFi lending is **capital-inefficient**. Protocols like Aave require **150% collateral** to borrow $100, making them unsuitable for genuine credit needs.

### Our Solution
Credo Protocol bridges this gap by creating an **identity-backed lending model**. Instead of relying solely on collateral, we assess creditworthiness based on verifiable on-chain and off-chain reputation.

### Key Innovation

**Traditional DeFi**: Borrow $100 → Need $150 collateral  
**Credo Protocol**: Borrow $100 → Need $50-$150 collateral (based on your credit score)

## 📋 How It Works

```
1. Login with Moca ID (Google/Email/Wallet)
   ↓
2. Request Verifiable Credentials (CEX, Employer, Bank)
   ↓
3. Submit Credentials → Build Credit Score On-Chain
   ↓
4. Supply USDC as Collateral
   ↓
5. Borrow with Personalized Terms (Score-Based)
```

### Example User Journey

**Alice's Story**:
1. Logs in with her Google account via Moca AIR Kit ✅
2. Submits 3 credentials: CEX history, Employment proof, Stable balance ✅
3. Credit score calculated: **862/1000** ✅
4. Supplies $1,000 USDC as collateral ✅
5. **Can borrow up to $1,667 USDC** (60% collateral requirement) vs $667 in traditional DeFi 🎉

## 💎 Credit Scoring System

### Collateral Requirements by Score

| Credit Score | Collateral Required | Borrowing Power (per $100 collateral) |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 900-1000     | 50%                 | $200                                   |
| 800-899      | 60%                 | $167                                   |
| 700-799      | 75%                 | $133                                   |
| 600-699      | 90%                 | $111                                   |
| 500-599      | 100%                | $100                                   |
| 400-499      | 110%                | $91                                    |
| 300-399      | 125%                | $80                                    |
| 0-299        | 150%                | $67 (Standard DeFi)                    |

### Score Calculation

```javascript
Base Score: 500

+ Credential Type Weights:
  • Proof of Stable Balance: +100 points
  • Proof of CEX History: +80 points
  • Proof of Employment: +70 points

× Issuer Trust Score: 0-100%
× Recency Decay: 70-100% (based on credential age)

+ Diversity Bonus: 5% per unique credential type (up to 25%)

= Final Score (0-1000, capped)
```

**Example**:
- 3 credentials (CEX + Employment + Bank Balance)
- Full issuer trust (100%)
- Recent submissions (100% recency)
- Calculation: (500 + 80 + 70 + 100) × 1.15 = **862**
