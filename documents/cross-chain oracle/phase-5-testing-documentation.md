# Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Prerequisites:** Phase 1-4 completed

---

## Overview

**Goal:** Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the cross-chain oracle implementation.

**What You'll Create:**
- Test checklist
- Updated README
- User guide
- Deployment documentation

---

## Step 5.1: Create Test Checklist

Create `documents/cross-chain oracle/test-checklist.md`:

```markdown
# Cross-Chain Oracle Testing Checklist

- [ ] Contracts deployed on Moca Devnet
- [ ] Contracts deployed on Sepolia
- [ ] Contracts deployed on Base Sepolia
- [ ] Oracle addresses configured
- [ ] Moca team registration complete
- [ ] Frontend environment variables set

## Moca Chain Tests
- [ ] Event emits successfully
- [ ] Message ID is unique
- [ ] Transaction confirms
- [ ] Gas cost reasonable (<0.001 MOCA)

## Target Chain Tests (Sepolia)
- [ ] Score received within 3 minutes
- [ ] Score matches Moca Chain
- [ ] Timestamp recorded correctly
- [ ] No duplicate submissions

## Target Chain Tests (Base)
- [ ] Score received within 3 minutes
- [ ] Score matches Moca Chain
- [ ] Timestamp recorded correctly
- [ ] Explorer link works

## Frontend Tests
- [ ] Relay button enabled when logged in
- [ ] Loading state shows during relay
- [ ] Success message displays
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Chain scores refresh
- [ ] External links work

## Edge Cases
- [ ] Relay with no score fails gracefully
- [ ] Relay to unsupported chain rejected
- [ ] Multiple relays don't duplicate
- [ ] Oracle downtime handled

## Documentation
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] Deployment addresses documented
- [ ] User guide created
```

---

## Step 5.2: Update README

Add cross-chain section to your `README.md`:

```markdown
## ðŸŒ‰ Cross-Chain Features

Credo credit scores are now available on multiple blockchains via Moca Identity Oracle:

### Supported Chains
- **Ethereum Sepolia** - Use your score on Ethereum DeFi
- **Base Sepolia** - Access Base ecosystem with your credit

### How It Works
1. Build your credit score on Moca Chain
2. Click "Relay Score" on any supported chain
3. Moca Oracle automatically relays within 2 minutes
4. Your score is now usable on that chain!

### Use Cases
- Borrow on Aave using Moca credit
- Get better rates on Compound
- Access gated DAOs on Ethereum
- Participate in Base DeFi with your reputation

### Technical Details
- **Oracle:** Moca Identity Oracle (BLS signatures)
- **Finality:** ~2 minutes average
- **Cost:** Free (oracle pays gas on destination)
- **Security:** Decentralized validator network (>2/3 consensus)
```

---

## Step 5.3: Create User Guide

Create `documents/cross-chain oracle/user-guide.md`:

```markdown
# Cross-Chain Credit Score - User Guide

## What is Cross-Chain Relay?

Your Credo credit score lives on Moca Chain. To use it on Ethereum or Base, 
you need to "relay" it using Moca's Identity Oracle.

## How to Relay Your Score

### Step 1: Build Credit Score
1. Login to Credo Protocol
2. Request credentials (Income, Bank Balance, etc.)
3. Submit credentials to contract
4. View your score on Score page

### Step 2: Relay to Another Chain
1. Find "Cross-Chain Credit Score" section
2. Choose destination chain
3. Click "Relay Score"
4. Approve transaction
5. Wait for confirmation

### Step 3: Wait for Oracle
- Oracle needs ~2 minutes to process
- Message ID displayed for tracking
- Refresh page to see updated status

### Step 4: Verify
- Green badge shows "Score: XXX"
- Click external link to view on explorer
- Your score is now on that chain!

## FAQ

**Q: How much does it cost?**  
A: Only Moca Chain gas (~0.0001 MOCA). Oracle pays destination gas.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
A: ~2 minutes average. Up to 5 minutes during high load.

**Q: Can I relay to multiple chains?**  
A: Yes! Relay to each chain separately.

**Q: Do I need to relay again if my score changes?**  
A: Yes. Click "Update" to relay new score.

## Success Metrics

**You'll know it's working when:**
- âœ… Transaction succeeds on Moca Chain
- âœ… Event appears in transaction logs
- âœ… Score appears on destination within 5 minutes
- âœ… Score matches Moca Chain exactly
- âœ… No error messages in frontend

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Oracle address not set"**
- Use placeholder address
- Update later with updateOracle()

**"Event not being relayed"**
- Verify Moca team registered your contract
- Check event signature matches

**"Transaction reverts"**
- User has no credit score
- Unsupported target chain ID

**"Score doesn't appear"**
- Wait longer (up to 5 minutes)
- Verify transaction confirmed on Moca Chain

## Buildathon Demo Tips

**How to Present (60 seconds):**

1. **Problem (10s):** "DeFi is fragmented. Your Ethereum credit doesn't work on Base."

2. **Solution (20s):** "Credo uses Moca Identity Oracle. Build credit once, use everywhere."

3. **Demo (30s):**
   - Show score on Moca: "862"
   - Click "Relay Score" â†’ Ethereum
   - Show confirmation
   - Show score on Ethereum: "862" âœ“

4. **Impact (10s):** "Users can now borrow on Aave, Compound, any DeFi protocol using Moca credit scores."
