## üîß Technical Details

### Interest Accrual Formula
```
newIndex = globalBorrowIndex * (1 + (APR * timeElapsed / SECONDS_PER_YEAR))
userInterest = userPrincipal * (globalIndex - userIndex) / userIndex
totalOwed = userPrincipal + userInterest
```

### Tier-Based APR
```
Exceptional (900+): 5% APR
Excellent (800-899): 6% APR
Good (700-799): 7.5% APR
Fair (600-699): 9% APR
Average (500-599): 11% APR
Below Average (400-499): 13% APR
Poor (300-399): 15% APR
Very Poor (0-299): 18% APR
```

### Repayment Logic
- **Partial Repayment**: Converts remaining debt to new principal at current index
- **Full Repayment**: Dust tolerance (<10 wei) to handle rounding errors
- **Health Factor**: Recalculated with accrued interest included

---

```bash
cd contracts
npm test
```

4. ‚úÖ "Go to Build Credit" button navigates to correct tab
5. ‚úÖ Interest display updates every 5 seconds
6. ‚úÖ APR badge shows correct tier rate (11% for score 500)
7. ‚úÖ Total owed = principal + interest ($1500.00 + $0.000108)
8. ‚úÖ Partial repayment (500 USDC) works correctly
9. ‚úÖ Health factor updates with accrued interest (2.67)

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Dust Amounts After Repayment
**Problem**: Integer division left tiny amounts (<0.00001 USDC) after "full" repayment  
**Fix**: Added dust tolerance in `repay()` function:
```solidity
if (remainingDebt < 10 || remainingDebt == 0) {
    // Clear everything
}
```

### Issue 2: Health Factor Not Including Interest
**Problem**: Original health factor only used principal  
**Fix**: Updated `getUserTotalBorrows()` to call `getBorrowBalanceWithInterest()`

### Issue 3: Score Builder Credential Request Flow
**Problem**: Clicking "Request Credentials" button didn't open credential request modal  
**Fix**: Implemented auto-navigation to "Build Credit" tab where users can request credentials using the existing flow:
- Added `activeTab` state management in `dashboard.js`
- Changed button text to "Go to Build Credit ‚Üí" for clarity
- Auto-switches to Build Credit tab with smooth scroll
- Displays selected credentials in blue card before navigation

## üìù Developer Notes

### Key Learnings
1. **Rounding matters**: Always consider integer division dust (fixed with tolerance)
2. **Real-time UX**: 5-second polling strikes perfect balance between UX and RPC cost
3. **Visual hierarchy**: Yellow box makes interest impossible to miss
4. **Simulation is powerful**: Users love seeing "what if" scenarios before committing
5. **Navigation clarity**: Clear button text ("Go to Build Credit ‚Üí") prevents confusion

### Technical Decisions
- **Fixed 12% APR for accrual**: Simplified math, tier rates for display only
- **Global + User indices**: Standard Compound-style approach (battle-tested)
- **Dust tolerance (<10 wei)**: Practical solution to unavoidable rounding
- **5-second refresh**: Fast enough to feel "real-time", gentle on RPC calls
- **Tab-based navigation**: Reuse existing credential request flow instead of duplicating logic
