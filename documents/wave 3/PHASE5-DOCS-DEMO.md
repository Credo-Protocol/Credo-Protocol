- **Real-Time Simulation**: Preview score changes before submitting credentials
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar showing "200 pts to next tier"
- **Transparent Breakdown**: View per-credential contributions with trust scores

#### ‚ö° Production-Ready Protocol
- **Interest Accrual**: Time-based interest (5-18% APR based on credit tier)
- **Live Interest Display**: Watch interest accrue every 5 seconds in real-time
- **Dynamic APR**: Lower rates for higher scores (5% vs 18%)
- **Testnet Deployment**: Live on Moca testnet for production testing

#### üåê Ecosystem Integration
- **Composable Credit API**: Public `/api/score/:address` endpoint
- **CORS Enabled**: Any dApp can query credit scores
