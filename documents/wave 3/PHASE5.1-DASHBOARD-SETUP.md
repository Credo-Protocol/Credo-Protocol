# Phase 5.1: AIR Kit Dashboard Setup

**Day**: 3 Morning (Oct 27)  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Phases 1-4 Complete  
**Next**: Phase 5.2 (Backend Refactor)

---

## üéØ Goal

Register your project as an official MOCA credential issuer and verifier in the AIR Kit Dashboard. This establishes your project's identity in the MOCA ecosystem and unlocks gas sponsorship.

**Why This Phase**: Without official Issuer DIDs and schemas, your credentials won't be recognized by the MOCA ecosystem. This is the foundation for true integration.

**What You'll Get**:
- ‚úÖ 3 Official Issuer DIDs (Bank, Employment, CEX)
- ‚úÖ 1 Verifier DID for credit score oracle
- ‚úÖ 10 Published credential schemas
- ‚úÖ 10 Verifier programs
- ‚úÖ Gas sponsorship enabled (paymaster)
- ‚úÖ Partner secret for backend JWT

---

## üìã What You're Creating

By the end of this phase, you'll have:

```yaml
Issuers:
  - Bank Balance Issuer (DID: did:moca:...)
  - Employment Issuer (DID: did:moca:...)
  - CEX History Issuer (DID: did:moca:...)

Verifier:
  - Credo Protocol (DID: did:moca:...)

Schemas:
  - 4 Bank Balance schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)
  - 4 Income Range schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)
  - 2 Legacy schemas (CEX/Employment)

Verifier Programs:
  - 10 programs (one per schema)

Gas Sponsorship:
  - Paymaster enabled
  - Policy configured
  - Wallet funded
```

- `bucketRange`: Use income ranges
- `dataSource`: Use "Mock Employer"
- `period`: Use "Monthly"

**Quick Reference**:
