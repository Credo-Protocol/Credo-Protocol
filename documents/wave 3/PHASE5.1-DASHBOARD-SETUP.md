# Phase 5.1: AIR Kit Dashboard Setup

**Day**: 3 Morning (Oct 27)  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Phases 1-4 Complete  
**Next**: Phase 5.2 (Backend Refactor)

---

## üéØ Goal

Register your project as an official MOCA credential issuer and verifier in the AIR Kit Dashboard. This establishes your project's identity in the MOCA ecosystem and unlocks gas sponsorship.

**Why This Phase**: Without official Issuer DID and schemas, your credentials won't be recognized by the MOCA ecosystem. This is the foundation for true integration.

**What You'll Get**:
- ‚úÖ 1 Official Issuer DID (Credo Protocol) - **Note**: Each partner account gets 1 Issuer DID per MOCA documentation
- ‚úÖ 1 Verifier DID for credit score oracle
- ‚úÖ 10 Published credential schemas (differentiated by type, not issuer)
- ‚úÖ 10 Verifier programs
- ‚úÖ Gas sponsorship enabled (paymaster)
- ‚úÖ Partner secret for backend JWT

---

## üìã What You're Creating

By the end of this phase, you'll have:

```yaml
Issuer:
  - Credo Protocol (DID: did:air:id:test:... - from General Settings)
    Issues all 10 credential types with clear schema differentiation

Verifier:
  - Credo Protocol (DID: did:key:... - from General Settings)

Schemas (all issued by Credo Protocol):
  - 4 Bank Balance schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)
  - 4 Income Range schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)  
  - 1 CEX History schema
  - 1 Employment Status schema

Verifier Programs:
  - 10 programs (one per schema)

Gas Sponsorship:
  - Paymaster enabled
  - Policy configured
  - Wallet funded
```

**Architecture Note**: This follows MOCA's standard model where Credo Protocol acts as a credential aggregator (like Plaid or Civic), issuing verifiable credentials for various data types under one trusted issuer identity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access AIR Kit Dashboard (5 min)

**URL**: [https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/](https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/)

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Click "Login with Moca ID"
3. Use your existing Google/Email account (same as your app)
4. You should see your existing partner account

**Verify Your Partner ID**:
- Go to **Account ‚Üí General**
- You should see your Partner ID (already in `.env.local`)

**Save for Reference**:
```bash
PARTNER_ID=[your-existing-partner-id]
```

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ Dashboard accessed, Partner ID confirmed

---

### Step 2: Verify Your Issuer DID & Verifier DID (5 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Account ‚Üí General

According to [MOCA's official documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/airkit-dashboard), each partner account automatically gets **1 Issuer DID** and **1 Verifier DID** upon account creation.

#### Locate Your DIDs

On the **General Settings** page, you'll see:

```yaml
Partner ID: 954fe820-050d-49fb-b22e-884922aa6cef
Issuer DID: did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl
Verifier DID: did:key:81eGFbL7uQQFjvbTMAyQv4XtzTv7wJJLpe
Name: AIR Partner e6ada70dcb524d9ba15c9f5080c0cf6f
Website URL: https://air3.com
```

**Copy both DIDs to your notes**:
```bash
# From General Settings
ISSUER_DID=did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl
VERIFIER_DID=did:key:81eGFbL7uQQFjvbTMAyQv4XtzTv7wJJLpe
```

**Important**: You'll use this **ONE Issuer DID** for all 10 credential schemas. Each schema will have a unique name and structure to differentiate credential types (Bank Balance, Income, Employment, CEX History).

#### Top Up Fee Wallet (Issuer)

1. Navigate to **Issuer ‚Üí Fee Wallet** in the left sidebar
2. Copy the wallet address displayed
3. Open [Moca Devnet Faucet](https://devnet-scan.mocachain.org/faucet)
4. Paste wallet address
5. Request **100 test MOCA**
6. Confirm transaction
7. Return to dashboard - balance should update to ~100 MOCA

#### Top Up Fee Wallet (Verifier)

1. Navigate to **Verifier ‚Üí Fee Wallet** in the left sidebar
2. Copy the wallet address displayed
3. Use faucet to send **100 test MOCA**
4. Confirm balance updated to ~100 MOCA

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ Issuer DID and Verifier DID confirmed and wallets funded

---

### Step 3: Update General Settings (Optional, 5 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Account ‚Üí General

You can optionally update your partner account information to better reflect Credo Protocol:

```yaml
Name: Credo Protocol
Website URL: https://credo-protocol.vercel.app
Logo URL: [your-logo-url if you have one]
JWKS URL: [leave empty for now - we'll handle JWT in backend]
```

Click **"Save"** to update.

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ General settings updated (optional)

---

### Step 4: Create Credential Schemas (45 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Issuer ‚Üí Schemas (in left sidebar)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: According to [official MOCA documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/usage/credential/schema-creation), schemas are created using the **Schema Builder UI**, NOT by pasting JSON. The dashboard provides a visual form builder.

You need to create **10 schemas total**. All schemas will automatically use your **Issuer DID** from General Settings.

---

**Schema Creation Checklist**:

```markdown
All schemas use your single ISSUER_DID (did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl)

Bank Balance Schemas:
- [ ] SCHEMA_BANK_HIGH ($10k+, weight: 150)
- [ ] SCHEMA_BANK_MEDIUM ($5k-$10k, weight: 120)
- [ ] SCHEMA_BANK_LOW ($1k-$5k, weight: 80)
- [ ] SCHEMA_BANK_MINIMAL (<$1k, weight: 40)

Income Range Schemas:
- [ ] SCHEMA_INCOME_HIGH ($8k+/mo, weight: 180)
- [ ] SCHEMA_INCOME_MEDIUM ($5k-$8k/mo, weight: 140)
- [ ] SCHEMA_INCOME_LOW ($3k-$5k/mo, weight: 100)
- [ ] SCHEMA_INCOME_MINIMAL (<$3k/mo, weight: 50)

Other Schemas:
- [ ] SCHEMA_CEX_HISTORY (weight: 80)
- [ ] SCHEMA_EMPLOYMENT (weight: 70)
```

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ All 10 schemas created and Schema IDs saved

---

### Step 4.5: About Issuance Programs (IMPORTANT NOTE - 5 min)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Read This Before Continuing!**

According to [MOCA Documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/airkit-dashboard#_2-issuance-program), there are **Issuance Programs** (also called "Credentials" in the dashboard) that configure how credentials are issued:

- **Accessible Until**: Date range for validity
- **Maximum Issuance**: Cap on total credentials
- **Expiration Duration**: Credential lifespan

**For Credo Protocol's use case**, you have two options:

#### **Option A: Skip Manual Creation** (Recommended ‚úÖ)
Since you'll issue credentials **programmatically via the SDK** (`airService.issueCredential()`), you can skip manually creating issuance programs in the dashboard. The SDK can handle issuance directly with your schemas.

**Pros**: Faster setup, more flexibility
**Cons**: No dashboard-configured limits/expiration

#### **Option B: Create Issuance Programs in Dashboard**
Navigate to **Issuer ‚Üí Credentials** and manually create 10 issuance programs (one per schema) with specific rules.

**Pros**: Dashboard management, built-in limits
**Cons**: More setup time, less flexible

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Option A for now. You can add issuance programs later if needed.

---

### Step 5: Create Verifier Programs (30 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Verifier ‚Üí Programs (in left sidebar)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: According to [official MOCA documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/airkit-dashboard#_1-verification-program-management), Verifier Programs define the logic for checking credential attributes using operators and values.

For each of your 10 schemas, you'll create a matching verification program.

---

#### How to Create a Verifier Program (Official Process)

According to [MOCA's Verification Documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/quickstart/verify-credentials#step-6-setup-verification-program):

1. Navigate to **Verifier ‚Üí Programs** in dashboard sidebar
2. Click **"Create Program"** or **"+ New Program"**
3. Fill in basic info:
   ```
   Program Name: Verify [Credential Name]
   Description: Verify [credential type] for credit score calculation
   ```
4. **Select Schema**: Choose the schema this program will verify (from dropdown)
5. **Define Verification Logic**: Add operators and attribute conditions
   - Example: attribute "weight" operator "greater than" value "0"
6. **Data Recovery**: Choose whether to allow data access (default: No)
7. Click **"Apply"** to deploy the program
8. **Copy the Program ID** (shown after deployment)

---

#### Program #1: Verify Bank Balance - High

**Configuration**:
```
Program Name: Verify Bank Balance - High
Description: Verify high bank balance credential for credit score oracle
Schema: Credo Bank Balance - High (select from dropdown)

Verification Logic:
- Attribute: weight
- Operator: greater than or equal to
- Value: 0

Data Recovery: No
```

**After creating, save**: `VERIFIER_PROGRAM_BANK_HIGH=[program-id]`

---

#### Quick Creation Guide for Remaining 9 Programs

**Follow the same process** for each schema. Here's your checklist:

```

**Note**: All 10 schemas use the **same Issuer DID** (Credo Protocol). Schemas are differentiated by their names, types, and credential subject properties.

---

## üéâ What You've Accomplished

After Phase 5.1, you now have:

‚úÖ **Official MOCA Identity**: 1 Issuer DID (Credo Protocol) + 1 Verifier DID  
‚úÖ **Public Schema Registry**: 10 published, discoverable schemas (all issued by Credo Protocol)  
‚úÖ **Verification Infrastructure**: 10 verifier programs  
‚úÖ **Gas Sponsorship**: Paymaster enabled and funded  
‚úÖ **Backend Authentication**: Partner secret for JWT generation  

**Your project is now officially registered in the MOCA ecosystem!** üéä

**Architecture**: Credo Protocol acts as a trusted credential aggregator (similar to Plaid or Civic), issuing verifiable credentials for various financial and identity data types under one unified issuer identity. This is the standard MOCA model and aligns with official documentation.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Proceed to Phase 5.2**: Backend Refactor

In Phase 5.2, you'll:
1. Add Partner JWT generation module
2. Refactor credential API routes
3. Update environment variables
4. Delete old mock issuer files
5. Test backend endpoints

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Can't find Schema Builder / Shows JSON editor"
- Make sure you're in **Issuer ‚Üí Schemas** section
- Look for "Create New Schema" button (not "Create Schema")
- The UI should show a visual form builder, not a code editor
- If you see JSON editor, contact MOCA support - dashboard may have changed

### "Schema validation failed"
- Ensure all required attributes are marked correctly
- Use descriptive names in camelCase format
- Check that attribute types match (String, Number, Boolean, Date)
- Review official docs: https://docs.moca.network/airkit/usage/credential/schema-creation

### "Can't find Verifier Programs section"
- Navigate to **Verifier** (not Issuer) in left sidebar
- Click on **Programs** subsection
- Should see list of existing programs and "Create Program" button

### "Paymaster not available"
- Access may need to be granted by MOCA team
- Contact MOCA Discord #dev-chat with your Partner ID
- Can proceed without for testing (users pay gas)
- Reference: https://docs.moca.network/airkit/usage/account/paymaster

### "Can't top up wallet from faucet"
- Faucet URL: https://devnet-scan.mocachain.org/faucet
- May have rate limits - try again in 5 minutes
- Ensure you're copying the correct wallet address from dashboard
- Use different browser if blocked

### "Issuer DID not showing in General Settings"
- You should have one automatically generated on account creation
- Refresh the dashboard page
- Check **Account ‚Üí General** section carefully
- If still missing, contact MOCA support - this should be automatic

---

**Phase 5.1 Status**: ‚úÖ Complete & Verified Against Official MOCA Docs  
**Next Phase**: Phase 5.2 - Backend Refactor  
**Time to Next**: Ready to proceed immediately
