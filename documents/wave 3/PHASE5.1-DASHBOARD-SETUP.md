# Phase 5.1: AIR Kit Dashboard Setup

**Day**: 3 Morning (Oct 27)  
**Duration**: 2 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Phases 1-4 Complete  
**Next**: Phase 5.2 (Backend Refactor)

---

## üéØ Goal

Register your project as an official MOCA credential issuer and verifier in the AIR Kit Dashboard. This establishes your project's identity in the MOCA ecosystem and unlocks gas sponsorship.

**Why This Phase**: Without official Issuer DID and schemas, your credentials won't be recognized by the MOCA ecosystem. This is the foundation for true integration.

**What You'll Get**:
- ‚úÖ 1 Official Issuer DID (Credo Protocol) - **Note**: Each partner account gets 1 Issuer DID per MOCA documentation
- ‚úÖ 1 Verifier DID for credit score oracle
- ‚úÖ 10 Published credential schemas (differentiated by type, not issuer)
- ‚úÖ 10 Verifier programs
- ‚úÖ Gas sponsorship enabled (paymaster)
- ‚úÖ Partner secret for backend JWT

---

## üìã What You're Creating

By the end of this phase, you'll have:

```yaml
Issuer:
  - Credo Protocol (DID: did:air:id:test:... - from General Settings)
    Issues all 10 credential types with clear schema differentiation

Verifier:
  - Credo Protocol (DID: did:key:... - from General Settings)

Schemas (all issued by Credo Protocol):
  - 4 Bank Balance schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)
  - 4 Income Range schemas (High/Medium/Low/Minimal)  
  - 1 CEX History schema
  - 1 Employment Status schema

Verifier Programs:
  - 10 programs (one per schema)

Gas Sponsorship:
  - Paymaster enabled
  - Policy configured
  - Wallet funded
```

**Architecture Note**: This follows MOCA's standard model where Credo Protocol acts as a credential aggregator (like Plaid or Civic), issuing verifiable credentials for various data types under one trusted issuer identity.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access AIR Kit Dashboard (5 min)

**URL**: [https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/](https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/)

1. Open the dashboard in your browser
2. Click "Login with Moca ID"
3. Use your existing Google/Email account (same as your app)
4. You should see your existing partner account

**Verify Your Partner ID**:
- Go to **Account ‚Üí General**
- You should see your Partner ID (already in `.env.local`)

**Save for Reference**:
```bash
PARTNER_ID=[your-existing-partner-id]
```

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ Dashboard accessed, Partner ID confirmed

---

### Step 2: Verify Your Issuer DID & Verifier DID (5 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Account ‚Üí General

According to [MOCA's official documentation](https://docs.moca.network/airkit/airkit-dashboard), each partner account automatically gets **1 Issuer DID** and **1 Verifier DID** upon account creation.

#### Locate Your DIDs

On the **General Settings** page, you'll see:

```yaml
Partner ID: 954fe820-050d-49fb-b22e-884922aa6cef
Issuer DID: did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl
Verifier DID: did:key:81eGFbL7uQQFjvbTMAyQv4XtzTv7wJJLpe
Name: AIR Partner e6ada70dcb524d9ba15c9f5080c0cf6f
Website URL: https://air3.com
```

**Copy both DIDs to your notes**:
```bash
# From General Settings
ISSUER_DID=did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl
VERIFIER_DID=did:key:81eGFbL7uQQFjvbTMAyQv4XtzTv7wJJLpe
```

**Important**: You'll use this **ONE Issuer DID** for all 10 credential schemas. Each schema will have a unique name and structure to differentiate credential types (Bank Balance, Income, Employment, CEX History).

#### Top Up Fee Wallet (Issuer)

1. Navigate to **Issuer ‚Üí Fee Wallet** in the left sidebar
2. Copy the wallet address displayed
3. Open [Moca Devnet Faucet](https://devnet-scan.mocachain.org/faucet)
4. Paste wallet address
5. Request **100 test MOCA**
6. Confirm transaction
7. Return to dashboard - balance should update to ~100 MOCA

#### Top Up Fee Wallet (Verifier)

1. Navigate to **Verifier ‚Üí Fee Wallet** in the left sidebar
2. Copy the wallet address displayed
3. Use faucet to send **100 test MOCA**
4. Confirm balance updated to ~100 MOCA

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ Issuer DID and Verifier DID confirmed and wallets funded

---

### Step 3: Update General Settings (Optional, 5 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Account ‚Üí General

You can optionally update your partner account information to better reflect Credo Protocol:

```yaml
Name: Credo Protocol
Website URL: https://credo-protocol.vercel.app
Logo URL: [your-logo-url if you have one]
JWKS URL: [leave empty for now - we'll handle JWT in backend]
```

Click **"Save"** to update.

**Status Check**: ‚úÖ General settings updated (optional)

---

### Step 4: Create Credential Schemas (45 min)

**Dashboard Path**: Issuer ‚Üí Schemas (in left sidebar)

You need to create **10 schemas total**. All schemas will use your **single Issuer DID** from Step 2. They're differentiated by their names, descriptions, and credential subject properties.

**Important**: For all schemas below, replace `[PASTE YOUR ISSUER_DID HERE]` with your actual Issuer DID from Step 2:
```
did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDl
```

---

#### Schema 1: Bank Balance - High

**Configuration**:

```json
{
  "schemaName": "Credo Bank Balance - High",

  }
}
```

**Steps**: Same process, save as `SCHEMA_BANK_MINIMAL`

---

#### Schemas 5-8: Income Range

Follow the same pattern as Bank Balance schemas, but with these changes:
- `issuerDid`: Use your **same ISSUER_DID** (Credo Protocol)
- `schemaType`: Change to `"IncomeRange"`
- `balanceBucket` ‚Üí `incomeBucket`
- `bucketRange`: Use income ranges
- `dataSource`: Use "Mock Employer"
- `period`: Use "Monthly"

**Quick Reference**:

| Schema | Bucket Name | Range | Weight | Save As |
|--------|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| 5 | INCOME_HIGH | $8,000+/month | 180 | SCHEMA_INCOME_HIGH |
| 6 | INCOME_MEDIUM | $5,000-$8,000/month | 140 | SCHEMA_INCOME_MEDIUM |

Verifier DID: [YOUR_VERIFIER_DID]
Associated Schema: [SELECT FROM DROPDOWN]
Verification Rules:
  - Credential must be valid and not expired
  - Issuer must be trusted (in your issuer list)
  - Credential must not be revoked
  - Subject must match the requester address
Acceptance Criteria:
  - Issuer reputation score > 0
  - Credential age < 1 year
  - No revocation on record
Auto-Accept: Yes (for testing)
```

## üìù Consolidated Environment Variables

**Save all of these for Phase 5.2** (Backend Refactor):

```bash
# Partner Authentication

```

**Note**: All 10 schemas use the **same Issuer DID** (Credo Protocol). Schemas are differentiated by their names, types, and credential subject properties.

---

## üéâ What You've Accomplished

After Phase 5.1, you now have:

‚úÖ **Official MOCA Identity**: 1 Issuer DID (Credo Protocol) + 1 Verifier DID  
‚úÖ **Public Schema Registry**: 10 published, discoverable schemas (all issued by Credo Protocol)  
‚úÖ **Verification Infrastructure**: 10 verifier programs  
‚úÖ **Gas Sponsorship**: Paymaster enabled and funded  
‚úÖ **Backend Authentication**: Partner secret for JWT generation  

**Your project is now officially registered in the MOCA ecosystem!** üéä

**Architecture**: Credo Protocol acts as a trusted credential aggregator (similar to Plaid or Civic), issuing verifiable credentials for various financial and identity data types under one unified issuer identity. This is the standard MOCA model and aligns with official documentation.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

**Proceed to Phase 5.2**: Backend Refactor

In Phase 5.2, you'll:
1. Add Partner JWT generation module
2. Refactor credential API routes
3. Update environment variables
4. Delete old mock issuer files
5. Test backend endpoints

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Can't create issuer - missing fields"
- Ensure all required fields filled
- Description must be at least 50 characters
- Email must be valid format

### "DID generation failed"
- Check internet connection
- Try refreshing dashboard
- Contact MOCA support if persists

### "Schema validation failed"
- Check JSON syntax (use JSONLint.com)
- Ensure issuerDid is valid format
- All required fields must be present

### "Paymaster not available"
- Access may not be instant
- Contact MOCA Discord #dev-chat
- Can proceed without for testing (users pay gas)

### "Can't top up wallet from faucet"
- Faucet may have rate limits
- Try again in 5 minutes
- Use different browser if blocked

---

**Phase 5.1 Status**: ‚úÖ Complete  
**Next Phase**: Phase 5.2 - Backend Refactor  
**Time to Next**: Ready to proceed immediately
