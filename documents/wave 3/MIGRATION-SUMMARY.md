# MOCA Integration Migration Summary

**Created**: Oct 25, 2025  
**Status**: Action Required  
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL

---

## üö® What You Need to Know

Your Credo Protocol currently uses **custom credential infrastructure** instead of MOCA's official AIR Kit credential services. This means:

‚ùå You're only using MOCA for **SSO/login** (20% of capabilities)  
‚ùå Your credentials are **NOT interoperable** with other MOCA dApps  
‚ùå You're **bypassing** the MOCA ecosystem  
‚ùå Users need **MOCA tokens** for every transaction (bad UX)  

---

## ‚úÖ What You Need to Do

### **Phase 5: MOCA Migration** (NEW - 6-8 hours, Split into 3 Sub-Phases)

**Overview Document**: `PHASE5-MOCA-MIGRATION.md`

This is now the **most critical** phase before finalizing Wave 3. It's been split into 3 focused sub-phases for easier execution.

#### Sub-Phase 5.1: Dashboard Setup (2 hours)

**Document**: `PHASE5.1-DASHBOARD-SETUP.md`

- Register 3 Issuer DIDs (Bank, Employment, CEX)
- Register 1 Verifier DID
- Create 10 credential schemas
- Create 10 verifier programs
- Configure paymaster (ERC-20 Paymaster active by default)
- Generate Partner secret for JWT

#### Sub-Phase 5.2: Backend Refactor (2-3 hours)

**Document**: `PHASE5.2-BACKEND-REFACTOR.md`

- Add Partner JWT generation module
- Replace mock issuers with credential metadata endpoints
- Delete `backend/src/issuers/*.js` files
- Update environment variables (20+ new vars)
- Test all API endpoints

#### Sub-Phase 5.3: Frontend Integration (2-3 hours)

**Document**: `PHASE5.3-FRONTEND-INTEGRATION.md`

- Update AIR Kit initialization with paymaster config
- Refactor credential issuance to use `airService.credential.issue()`
- ERC-20 Paymaster: Users pay gas with USDC/MOCA automatically
- Optional: Add sponsored paymaster policy ID for zero-cost txs
- Create credential wallet component
- Update environment variables
- Test end-to-end with gas sponsorship

## üìä Current vs. Target Architecture

### Current (Wrong)
```
User ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Your Backend (mock issuers) 
                  ‚Üì Manual signatures
                  ‚Üì Local storage
                  ‚Üí Smart Contract
```

### Target (Official MOCA)
```
User ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Your Backend (JWT generation)
                  ‚Üì Auth token
                  ‚Üì AIR Kit credential.issue()
                  ‚Üì MOCA Chain Storage Providers (MCSP)
                  ‚Üí Credential in AIR Wallet
                  ‚Üí Smart Contract (with proof)
```

## üéØ Benefits After Migration

### For Your Project
‚úÖ Credentials interoperable across MOCA ecosystem  
‚úÖ Gas-sponsored transactions (better UX)  
‚úÖ Decentralized storage on MCSP  
‚úÖ Issuer reputation tracking  
‚úÖ True ecosystem integration  

### For Demo/Judges
‚úÖ Can say "official MOCA integration" (not just login)  
‚úÖ Show credentials in AIR Kit Dashboard  
‚úÖ Demonstrate gas sponsorship  
‚úÖ Highlight decentralized storage  
‚úÖ Prove ecosystem interoperability

## üìã Action Plan

### Step 1: Read Overview Document
- Open `PHASE5-MOCA-MIGRATION.md` (overview)
- Understand the migration architecture
- Review the 3 sub-phase structure

### Step 2: Execute Phase 5.1 (Dashboard Setup)
- Open `PHASE5.1-DASHBOARD-SETUP.md`
- Login: https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/
- Register all DIDs and create schemas
- Enable gas sponsorship
- Save all credentials (20+ env vars)

### Step 3: Execute Phase 5.2 (Backend Refactor)
- Open `PHASE5.2-BACKEND-REFACTOR.md`
- Add `backend/src/auth/jwt.js`
- Update `backend/src/routes/credentials.js`
- Delete old issuer files
- Update `.env` with saved values
- Test all API endpoints

### Step 4: Execute Phase 5.3 (Frontend Integration)
- Open `PHASE5.3-FRONTEND-INTEGRATION.md`
- Update AIR Kit initialization
- Refactor credential issuance flow
- Create credential wallet component
- Update `.env.local`
- Test end-to-end with gas sponsorship

### Step 5: Verify Complete Migration
- Run all tests from each sub-phase
- Verify gas sponsorship working
- Check AIR Kit Dashboard
- Confirm MCSP storage

### Step 6: Proceed to Phase 6
- Only after ALL 3 sub-phases complete
- Update documentation
- Prepare demo
- Submit

## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline

**Phase 5.1** (Dashboard): 2 hours  
**Phase 5.2** (Backend): 2-3 hours  
**Phase 5.3** (Frontend): 2-3 hours  
**Phase 5 Total**: 6-8 hours (split over 1-2 days recommended)  

**Phase 6** (Docs & Demo): 4-6 hours  

**Total**: 10-14 hours to properly integrate with MOCA

## üö® Critical Warnings

### DO NOT Skip Phase 5
Without Phase 5:
- Judges will see you only use MOCA for login
- You can't claim "MOCA ecosystem integration"
- You won't stand out from basic integrations
- You'll miss gas sponsorship benefits

### DO NOT Proceed to Phase 6 Until:
- [ ] All 3 Issuer DIDs registered
- [ ] All 10 schemas created
- [ ] Gas sponsorship working
- [ ] Credentials appear in AIR Kit Dashboard
- [ ] Credentials stored on MCSP
- [ ] Backend using Partner JWT
- [ ] Frontend using `airService.credential.issue()`

---

## üí° Why This Matters

**Currently**: Your project is "Credo Protocol using MOCA for login"  
**After Phase 5**: Your project is "Credo Protocol - A MOCA Ecosystem DApp"

This is the difference between:
- ‚ùå Basic integration (using MOCA as a tool)
- ‚úÖ True ecosystem participation (contributing to MOCA)

Judges will recognize the difference immediately.

## üìû Need Help?

**If stuck on:**
- **Dashboard setup**: Check MOCA Discord #dev-chat
- **JWT generation**: See `backend/src/auth/jwt.js` example in Phase 5 doc
- **AIR Kit API**: Read https://docs.moca.network/airkit/usage/credential/
- **Gas payment**: ERC-20 Paymaster active (users pay with USDC/MOCA)
- **Sponsored gas**: Contact MOCA support to enable sponsored paymaster policy

**Remember**: This migration is worth it. It transforms your project from "good" to "excellent" in judges' eyes.
