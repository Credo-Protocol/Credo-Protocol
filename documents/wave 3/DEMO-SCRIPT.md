## 🎬 Act 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

### Screen: Landing Page

**[Open https://credo-protocol.vercel.app]**

### Talking Points:

> "Let me show you the **fundamental inefficiency** in current DeFi lending."
> 
> **[Point to hero section]**
> 
> "Traditional DeFi protocols like Aave require **150% collateral** to borrow $100. Technically, they use a **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 67%** - meaning your collateral value must be 1.5x your borrow amount at all times, or you get liquidated."
> 
> "This exists because **DeFi has no identity layer**. Smart contracts can't verify who you are, what you earn, or if you'll repay. So they require massive over-collateralization as the only risk mitigation."
> 
> **[Scroll to problem section]**
> 
> "Credo Protocol solves this with **on-chain credit scoring using verifiable credentials**. We bridge off-chain identity - your job, income, bank balance - into DeFi through cryptographic proofs. Think FICO scores, but **decentralized, privacy-preserving, and composable**."

**Time Check**: 0:30

---

## 🎬 Act 2: The Journey (3 minutes 15 seconds)

### Part A: Login & Dashboard Overview (30 seconds)

**[Click "Get Started" - navigates to /dashboard]**

### Talking Points:

> "First, I'll login with **Moca ID** - this uses AIR Kit's Account Services, which is MOCA's native authentication SDK."
> 
> **[Click "Login with Moca ID" - already connected for demo]**
> 
> "Under the hood, AIR Kit creates a **smart contract wallet** for me - it's an EIP-4337 Account Abstraction wallet. This means I can login with Google, email, or any Web2 method, but I get a non-custodial Ethereum wallet. The private key is managed via **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** - no single point of failure."
> 
> **[Dashboard loads - overview page with stats cards]**
> 
> "Now I'm authenticated on-chain. My wallet address is deterministically derived from my Moca ID. The frontend uses AIR Kit's **EIP-1193 provider** to interact with smart contracts - same interface as MetaMask, but smoother UX."
> 
> **[Point to Credit Score Card - top left]**
> 
> "Current credit score: **[YOUR_SCORE]** - that's **[YOUR_TIER]** tier. This is fetched from our **CreditScoreOracle smart contract** via a get credit score view call. The contract computes this on-chain based on my submitted credentials."
> 
> **[Point to Collateral Factor Card - center]**
> 
> "My collateral factor is **[YOUR_FACTOR]%** - this is calculated client-side based on the tier returned from the get tier for score function. The large animated number shows exactly how much collateral I need to borrow."
> 
> **[Point to Login Method Card - right]**
> 
> "You can see I logged in with **[Email/Google or Moca ID]** - AIR Kit supports multiple authentication methods, all backed by the same smart contract wallet."
> 
> **[Scroll down to Quick Links]**
> 
> "The dashboard has quick navigation to all major features - Credentials, Lending Pool, Score Builder, and Faucet. This is our mission control."

**Time Check**: 1:00

---

### Part B: Score Builder Wizard (40 seconds)

**[Click "Score Builder" quick link card from dashboard - navigates to /score page]**

### Talking Points:

> "Let me show you our **Score Builder Wizard** - this is a dedicated tool that helps users optimize their credit score before submitting credentials."
> 
> **[Page loads showing Current Score vs Simulated Score cards]**
> 
> "This runs the exact same scoring algorithm as our smart contract, but client-side in React. Left side shows my current on-chain score. Right side shows what I could achieve."
> 
> **[Scroll down to credential selector]**
> 
> "Here's the interactive part. When I select Income Range credential..."
> 
> **[Click Income Range credential card]**
> 
> **[Simulated score updates in real-time]**
> 
> "Watch the right side update! The algorithm calculates: **Base weight (180 points for high income) × Issuer trust score (100%) × Recency factor (100% for new credentials) = 180 points**. Then it adds a **diversity bonus** - 5% per unique credential type I have. My simulated score jumps from **[CURRENT]** to **[SIMULATED]**!"
> 
> **[Point to progress bar in middle section]**
> 
> "The progress bar shows distance to the next tier threshold. Our smart contract has **8 tiers stored on-chain** - from Exceptional (900-1000) down to Very Poor (0-299). Each tier unlocks different collateral ratios and APR rates."
> 
> **[Select Bank Balance credential]**
> 
> "Add Bank Balance... now **[NEW_SCORE]**. Notice the **'Privacy-First'** and **'Highest Weight'** badges. These are **bucketed credentials** - the smart contract only stores bucket names like Income High or Bank Balance Medium as cryptographic hashes, never exact amounts. Privacy-first by design - we use **range proofs** conceptually."

**Time Check**: 1:40

---

### Part C: Request Credential (MOCA Integration) (1 minute 20 seconds)

**[Click "Go to Build Credit →" button at bottom of selected credentials section]**

**[Page navigates to /credentials - Marketplace tab]**

### Talking Points:

> "Now let me request one of these credentials to show the **deep MOCA integration**."
> 
> **[Credentials page loads - Marketplace tab showing all available credential types]**
> 
> "This is our credential marketplace - you can see all 11 credential types organized by category: Income Range, Bank Balance, Employment, and CEX History. Each shows the point range, privacy level, and tier impact."
> 
> **[Click "Request Credential" on Income Range - High credential]**
> 
> "Here's where Credo becomes a **true MOCA ecosystem participant** - not just using MOCA for login, but fully integrated with AIR Kit's credential infrastructure."
> 
> **[Modal opens - Step 1: Prepare]**
> 
> "First, our backend prepares the credential. It's generating a **Partner JWT** - that's an RS256-signed JSON Web Token with our official Partner ID, Issuer DID, and Program ID."
> 
> **[Step 1 completes quickly]**
> 
> "The backend also exposes a **JWKS endpoint** at the well-known jwks.json path - this is how MOCA's AIR Kit validates our identity cryptographically. No shared secrets, just public key cryptography."
> 
> **[Step 2: Issue credential - Processing begins]**
> 
> "Now the frontend calls AIR Kit's credential issuance service. Watch what happens..."
> 
> **[While credential is processing - ~40 seconds total]**
> 
> "Behind the scenes - and this is critical - here's the technical flow:
> 
> **Step 1**: AIR Kit validates our Partner JWT by fetching our public key from the JWKS endpoint.
> 
> **Step 2**: AIR Kit signs the credential using **W3C Verifiable Credentials standard** - not our custom signature scheme. This creates a proper JSON-LD credential with cryptographic proof.
> 
> **Step 3**: The credential is stored on **MOCA Chain Storage Providers** - that's MCSP, a decentralized storage network. Not our database, not MOCA's centralized servers. This is the loading we're seeing now.
> 
> **[Point to loading indicator]**
> 
> **Step 4**: The credential gets added to my AIR Kit wallet automatically. If you go to the AIR Kit Dashboard right now, you'd see this credential listed under our Issuer DID.
> 
> **Step 5**: Any MOCA dApp can now discover and verify this credential. It's ecosystem-interoperable, not siloed to Credo."
> 
> **[Credential still processing - fill remaining time]**
> 
> "This is **completely different from Wave 2**. Before, we had mock issuers generating EIP-191 signatures locally. Now:
> - Official **Issuer DIDs** registered in MOCA's registry
> - **MCSP decentralized storage** instead of local
> - **W3C standard compliance** for interoperability
> - **Public schema registry** - other dApps can read our credential definitions
> 
> We're using **ERC-20 Paymaster** - users pay gas with USDC/MOCA automatically, no native gas tokens needed! We can also enable sponsored paymaster with a policy ID for completely free transactions."
> 
> **[Credential completes - Success message with MCSP badge appears]**
> 
> "There it is! Notice the **'Stored on MCSP'** badge. That credential is now:
> - ✅ Signed by official AIR Kit
> - ✅ Stored on decentralized infrastructure
> - ✅ Visible in AIR Kit Dashboard
> - ✅ Verifiable by any MOCA dApp
> - ✅ Follows W3C VC standard
> 
> That's **real MOCA Credential Services** - not mock signatures we generated ourselves!"
> 
> **[Navigate to "My Wallet" tab]**
> 
> "Now let me show you how users view their credentials."
> 
> **[Page switches to wallet tab showing issued credentials]**
> 
> "Here's where we made a **pragmatic architectural choice**. You can see my issued credentials with full details - type, issuance date, expiry status, MCSP storage badge."
> 
> **[Point to credential cards]**
> 
> "Interestingly, **AIR Kit doesn't currently provide a programmatic API** to retrieve a user's full credential wallet. According to MOCA's documentation, credentials are:
> - ✅ Encrypted and stored on MCSP
> - ✅ Controlled by the user (self-sovereign)
> - ✅ Only accessed during verification credential flows via built-in UI
> 
> There's no get credentials method to list them."
> 
> **[Point to the credential list]**
> 
> "So we built a **lightweight issuer tracking system**: When we issue a credential, we keep track of **what Credo Protocol issued** - just the credential ID, the bucket type like 'Income High', issuance date, and expiration date. This is **not storing the actual credential** - that's encrypted on MCSP. We're just tracking **'what credentials did Credo Protocol issue to this user?'** as the issuer.
> 
> **How Credential Viewing Currently Works in AIR Kit:**
> 
> Right now, the **only** way users see their credentials is during **verification flows**. When a verifier calls the verify credential function, AIR Kit opens a **built-in UI widget** that shows the user's credentials and lets them select which one to present. The user sees their wallet, chooses the credential, and shares it with the verifier.
> 
> But there's no standalone 'view my wallet' feature - no API to just list credentials outside of verification. This makes sense from a privacy perspective - you only see credentials when you need to present them.
> 
> **How Credential Viewing Should Work:**
> 
> Ideally, to see a user's **full credential wallet** proactively - including credentials from ALL issuers across the ecosystem - you'd use **MOCA's official APIs**. Something like an AIR Kit method that retrieves encrypted credentials from MCSP that only the user has permission to decrypt. That would be the privacy-preserving approach for building wallet interfaces.
> 
> But currently, AIR Kit doesn't expose that API. There's no get credentials method. So as the **issuer**, we track what **we** issued. This is legitimate - issuers need to know what they've issued for management purposes like checking expiry dates or handling revocations.
> 
> **Privacy compliance**: We can only see credentials from **Credo Protocol** - our own issuances. We can't see credentials from other issuers like employment credentials from another company or bank balance credentials from a different financial institution. That would require the user's permission and would need to go through MOCA's verification flows. The UI clearly says **'Credentials Issued by Credo Protocol'**, not 'All Your Credentials'."
> 
> **[Point to MCSP badge on credential card]**
> 
> "The actual credential data - the encrypted verifiable credential - is still on MCSP. If our backend database disappeared, users wouldn't lose their credentials. They'd just need to re-verify via AIR Kit's verify credential flow.
> 
> As the issuer, we can also view all issued credentials in the [AIR Kit Dashboard](https://developers.sandbox.air3.com/) under **Issuer → Records** - that's MOCA's official issuer management interface."
> 
> **[Click to proceed to blockchain submission]**
> 
> "Now we submit the credential hash to our smart contract on-chain for credit scoring."

**Time Check**: 3:00

### Part D: Lending Power & Pool Transparency (45 seconds)

**[Navigate back to Dashboard, then click "Lending Pool" quick link card - goes to /lending page]**

### Talking Points:

> "Now let's see how credit scores unlock better lending terms through **smart contract logic**."
> 
> **[Lending page loads - point to pool statistics card at top]**
> 
> "First, notice the **pool transparency** - we display real-time liquidity metrics just like Aave or Compound. The contract exposes the assets function that returns total liquidity, total borrowed, and we calculate utilization rate client-side. This shows **$[TOTAL_LIQUIDITY]** total liquidity with **[UTILIZATION]%** utilization. Users can see available liquidity before attempting to borrow."
> 
> **[Point to Moca Chain badge above pool stats]**
> 
> "The Moca Chain badge clearly indicates which network we're on - this is especially important as MOCA ecosystem grows."
> 
> **[Scroll down to Position Card on the left side]**
> 
> "The layout is optimized for UX - position overview on the left, supply and borrow actions on the right. This reduces eye movement on wide screens."
> 
> **[Point to Earnings Overview section if you have supplied]**
> 
> "Here's a key improvement: **lenders now earn interest too**. My supplied amount shows **$[SUPPLIED]**, and I'm earning interest in real-time at **[APY]% APY**. The APY is calculated as borrow APR times utilization rate - so lenders benefit when the pool is actively used. My earned interest updates every 5 seconds: **$[EARNED_INTEREST]**. This is calculated frontend based on time elapsed since supply."
> 
> **[Point to Debt Overview section if you have borrowed]**
> 
> "On the debt side, with my **[YOUR_SCORE]** credit score, my tier has a **collateral factor of [COLLATERAL]%** stored on-chain. The contract uses per-user borrow indices - similar to Compound's model. My borrowed amount of **$[BORROWED]** accrues interest continuously at **[YOUR_APR]% APR**. Total owed including interest: **$[TOTAL_OWED]**."
> 
> **[Point to Net Interest summary at bottom]**
> 
> "The Net Interest calculation shows my overall position: earnings minus debt. If I'm earning **$2.50** from supplying but paying **$1.20** in borrow interest, my net is **+$1.30** - I'm earning while borrowing. This is the power of using collateral productively."
> 
> **[Point to Withdraw button if time permits]**
> 
> "Lenders can withdraw their collateral anytime. The withdraw modal includes **health factor checks** - it pre-calculates the maximum safe withdrawal amount considering any debt, preventing users from accidentally liquidating themselves. That's **production-grade safety**."

**Time Check**: 3:45

---

### Part E: Credentials Page Enhancement (15 seconds)

**[Optional: If time permits, navigate to /credentials page]**

### Talking Points:

> **[If showing credentials page]**
> 
> "Quick note on the credentials page - we added a **credit score summary bar** at the top."
> 
> **[Point to credit score number and progress bar]**
> 
> "Your current score is prominently displayed with a visual progress bar scaled from 0-100. The color changes based on tier - red for poor, yellow for fair, green for good and excellent. This gives users immediate feedback on their creditworthiness before diving into credentials."

**Time Check**: 4:00

---

## 🎬 Act 3: Ecosystem Value (1 minute)

### Part A: Leaderboard (15 seconds)

**[Navigate back to Score Builder page - can click from dashboard or navbar]**

**[Scroll down to Leaderboard section below the Score Builder Wizard]**

### Talking Points:

> "Here's our **live leaderboard** - this queries the blockchain for score computation events from the last 10,000 blocks. We're limited to 10 thousand blocks by MOCA's RPC infrastructure - that's about 8 to 10 hours of history."
> 
> **[Point to top users in the leaderboard]**
> 
> "The frontend queries the blockchain for indexed events emitted every time someone submits a credential. Each event contains the user address, base score, component breakdown, diversity bonus, and final score. We aggregate by user, keep the latest score, and sort in descending order."
> 
> **[Point to trophy icons for top 3]**
> 
> "This demonstrates **network effects** - users compete for rank with trophy rewards for top 3. But more importantly, it shows **on-chain transparency** - all scoring is auditable via events."

**Time Check**: 4:15

---

### Part B: Composable API (30 seconds)

**[Open new tab to API endpoint]**

**[Navigate to the API endpoint with your demo address]**

### Talking Points:

> "Now here's where Credo becomes **composable infrastructure** for the entire ecosystem."
> 
> **[Show JSON response]**
> 
> "This is a Next.js API route. When you hit this endpoint, the backend:
> 1. Creates a JSON-RPC provider connection to Moca Chain
> 2. Instantiates our CreditScoreOracle contract
> 3. Calls the get credit score function - a view function that costs no gas
> 4. Calls the get tier for score function to retrieve collateral factors
> 5. Caches the result for 60 seconds in memory
> 
> The CORS headers are set to allow any origin - so any website or app can call this API."
> 
> **[Scroll through response]**
> 
> "The response includes the score, tier level, borrowing power calculations, and **integration examples**. Other dApps can:
> - **GameFi**: Call our API to gate content by score
> - **DAOs**: Weight votes by calling our oracle directly on-chain
> - **DeFi protocols**: Read our oracle for dynamic collateral ratios
> 
> We've also included a **Solidity interface** with all the function signatures. Any smart contract can import this interface and query our oracle directly without trusting our API centralized endpoint."
> 
> **[Point to Solidity example]**
> 
> "See? One line of Solidity gives you a user's creditworthiness as an unsigned integer. That's true composability."

**Time Check**: 4:15

---

### Part C: Testnet Explorer (15 seconds)

**[Open Moca Devnet Explorer in new tab]**

**[Navigate to your Oracle contract on the block explorer]**

### Talking Points:

> "All of this is **deployed and live on Moca Devnet** - Chain ID 5151. These contracts are verified, meaning the source code is publicly readable."
> 
> **[Show contract address]**
> 
> "Here's our CreditScoreOracle contract address. The explorer shows:
> - **Contract bytecode** - the compiled EVM opcodes
> - **Source code** - because we verified it with Hardhat, the Solidity is published
> - **ABI** - the JSON interface other contracts can use
> - **Read and Write functions** - you can query the get credit score function right from the explorer
> 
> **[Click on 'Contract' tab if visible]**
> 
> "This transparency is critical. Anyone can audit our scoring algorithm, verify the tier configurations, check issuer trust scores. **No black boxes** - everything is on-chain and immutable unless we deploy a new version."

**Time Check**: 4:45

---

## 🎬 Act 4: Vision & Next Steps (30 seconds)

### Screen: Back to Dashboard or Landing

### Talking Points:

> "So what have we built from a **technical architecture** perspective?
> 
> **For Users**: 
> - **2-3x capital efficiency** - collateral requirements from 150% down to 50%
> - **Privacy-preserving proofs** - range buckets, not exact amounts on-chain
> - **Transparent scoring** - all logic is in smart contracts with event emissions
> 
> **For Developers**:
> - **REST API** with 60 second caching and CORS headers - instant integration
> - **Solidity interfaces** - a credit score oracle interface anyone can import
> - **On-chain oracle** - view functions that cost zero gas to query
> - **Standardized events** - score computed events with full breakdown for indexing
> 
> **For MOCA Ecosystem**:
> - **Official AIR Kit integration** - Partner JWT authentication with RS256 + JWKS
> - **MCSP decentralized storage** - credentials stored on-chain, not in databases
> - **W3C VC compliance** - JSON-LD credentials with cryptographic proofs
> - **ERC-20 Paymaster active** - users pay gas with USDC/MOCA (no native tokens needed)
> - **Sponsored Paymaster ready** - can enable zero-cost txs via policy ID
> - **Ecosystem interoperability** - any MOCA dApp can discover our credentials
> 
> This is just the beginning. The technical roadmap includes:
> - **Plaid API integration** - real bank balance OAuth instead of simulated data
> - **Zero-knowledge range proofs** via AIR Kit's ZK services - prove income exceeds a threshold without revealing the exact amount
> - **MOCA Identity Oracle** for cross-chain verification - port your score to Ethereum or Polygon
> - **Liquidation keepers** with Chainlink price feeds - production-grade risk management
> - **Tokenized vault standards** - composable yield on supplied collateral
> 
> Credo Protocol brings **TradFi credit concepts to Web3** with **cryptographic guarantees** and **on-chain transparency**. We're making DeFi accessible to **everyone**, not just crypto-wealthy users."
> 
> **[Pause]**
> 
> "Questions?"

**Time Check**: 5:15

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "How do you verify credentials are real?"**
> A: "Great question! Currently we simulate credentials for demo purposes. In production, the flow would be:
> 
> **Technical Architecture:**
> 1. **Backend integrates with data providers**: Plaid SDK for bank data, Exchange APIs (Coinbase/Binance OAuth), payroll systems (Gusto/ADP)
> 2. **OAuth flow**: User authorizes our backend to fetch their data from the provider
> 3. **Backend validates**: Checks API response signatures, ensures data freshness
> 4. **Credential issuance**: Backend generates Partner JWT, AIR Kit signs with our Issuer DID
> 5. **On-chain submission**: User submits to smart contract
> 
> The smart contract validates the **cryptographic signature** from our Issuer DID - it doesn't know if underlying data is 'real'. That's the **trust layer**: our Issuer DID has a trust score (0-100) stored on-chain. If we issue fake credentials, the community can **deactivate our issuer** via governance, immediately invalidating all our credentials.
> 
> It's like SSL certificates - the contract verifies the signature, users trust the issuer."

**Q: "What prevents Sybil attacks?"**
> A: "Great security question! Multiple layers prevent Sybil attacks:
> 
> **Layer 1: Data Provider KYC**
> - **CEX accounts**: Exchanges require government ID verification (KYC/AML)
> - **Bank accounts**: Plaid connects to banks that require identity verification
> - **Payroll**: Employers verify identity for tax purposes (W-2, SSN)
> 
> **Layer 2: Credential Uniqueness**
> - Smart contract uses cryptographic hashing of credential data as a unique identifier
> - Same credential submitted twice = rejected on-chain
> - Each credential type has a **cooldown period** (e.g., can't submit new income proof every day)
> 
> **Layer 3: Issuer Accountability**
> - Our Issuer DID is registered on-chain with a trust score
> - If we issue fraudulent credentials, we can be **deactivated via governance**
> - All our issued credentials would be invalidated instantly
> 
> **Layer 4: Economic Incentives**
> - Creating fake Coinbase accounts is expensive (KYC services charge)
> - Credential recency decay means old credentials lose value over time
> - Cost of Sybil attack > benefit gained from slightly better rates
> 
> You can't easily create 100 fake identities - each requires real KYC'd accounts."

**Q: "How is this better than just using tokenbound accounts or on-chain history?"**
> A: "On-chain activity only shows what you've done with crypto. Credo bridges **off-chain identity** - your job, bank balance, salary - things that matter in traditional credit. Most people have more financial history off-chain than on-chain. We're bringing that into DeFi."

**Q: "What happens if someone defaults? No liquidation mechanism shown."**
> A: "Correct - this is a **testnet demonstration**, not mainnet-ready. The technical architecture for production would require:
> 
> **Liquidation Mechanism (Phase 2):**
> 1. **Price Oracles**: Integrate Chainlink price feeds for USDC/collateral valuation
> 2. **Health Factor Monitoring**: health factor equals collateral value times liquidation threshold divided by total debt
> 3. **Liquidator Incentives**: When healthFactor < 1.0, anyone can liquidate for 5-10% bonus
> 4. **Partial Liquidations**: Only liquidate enough to restore health, not entire position
> 
> **Additional Safety Mechanisms:**
> 1. **Interest Rate Model**: Utilization-based rates (like Aave) to discourage 100% borrowing
> 2. **Borrow Caps**: Per-user limits based on credit tier (e.g., Exceptional tier: max $50k)
> 3. **Protocol Insurance Fund**: 10% of interest revenue goes to insurance pool
> 4. **Keeper Network**: Off-chain bots monitor positions, call liquidate() when needed
> 
> **Credit-Specific Features:**
> 1. **Grace Periods**: Higher credit scores get 24-48 hour grace before liquidation
> 2. **Score Penalties**: Liquidated users lose 50-100 credit points (social cost)
> 3. **Repayment Plans**: Option to restructure debt before liquidation for good credit
> 
> This buildathon focused on **proving the credential infrastructure works** - getting 10 W3C credentials from AIR Kit into our smart contract. Liquidation logic is standard DeFi - we can add it once the identity layer is validated."

**Q: "Can users game the system by requesting the same credential multiple times?"**
> A: "No - the smart contract uses the credential hash as a unique identifier. Same credential submitted twice gets rejected. Also, credentials **decay over time** with weight ranging from 70 to 100 percent based on age, so old credentials become less valuable. Users are incentivized to update with fresh credentials."

**Q: "Why Moca Chain? Why not Ethereum?"**
> A: "MOCA provides **vertical integration** for decentralized identity that would take months to build on Ethereum. Here's the technical comparison:
> 
> **On Ethereum, we'd need to:**
> 1. Build our own **Issuer DID registry** (custom smart contract)
> 2. Implement **W3C VC signing** logic ourselves
> 3. Set up **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage
> 4. Build **EIP-4337 bundler** infrastructure for account abstraction
> 5. Create **paymaster contracts**, fund them, and handle ERC-20 gas conversion manually
> 6. Build credential verification logic from scratch
> 
> **On MOCA, we get:**
> 1. **AIR Kit Dashboard** - register Issuer DIDs in UI, instant
> 2. **Partner JWT plus JWKS** - proven auth pattern with AIR Kit credential issuance
> 3. **MCSP built-in** - decentralized storage handled automatically
> 4. **AIR Kit wallets** - EIP-4337 AA wallets with MPC key management
> 5. **ERC-20 Paymaster built-in** - users pay with USDC/MOCA automatically, sponsor with policy ID
> 6. **Schema registry** - W3C VC templates already deployed
> 
> **Time Saved**: ~3-4 months of infrastructure work → 2 weeks integration
> 
> **Strategic Fit**: Moca's gaming/entertainment ecosystem aligns perfectly. Gamers have:
> - Exchange accounts (high trading volume)
> - On-chain NFT/token activity
> - Social reputation (Discord, Twitter)
> - But no traditional credit history
> 
> They're **credit-invisible** to TradFi banks but **credit-visible** to our on-chain scoring. Perfect initial market."

**Q: "How do users view their credentials? Aren't they supposed to be private?"**
> A: "Excellent question about the architecture! Here's the nuanced answer:
> 
> **Current Implementation:**
> - Our UI shows **'Credentials Issued by Credo Protocol'** - not all credentials
> - We track only **what we issued** as the issuer - that's our legitimate role
> - Stored data: credential ID, bucket type, dates - NOT the encrypted credential itself
> - The actual credential with the W3C standard cryptographic proof lives on MCSP
> 
> **Why This Approach:**
> - Currently, credentials are **only shown during verification flows** through AIR Kit's built-in UI widget
> - AIR Kit doesn't expose an API method to retrieve a user's full credential wallet from MCSP for display purposes
> - To build a standalone wallet view showing ALL credentials (from all issuers), you'd need MOCA to provide an official API that queries MCSP with user permission
> - As the **issuer**, we legitimately track what we've issued for management purposes like revocation and expiry monitoring
> 
> **Privacy Compliance:**
> - We can only see **our own issuances** - credentials from Credo Protocol
> - We can't see credentials from OTHER issuers - that's the proper self-sovereign model
> - To see credentials from other issuers would require the user's explicit consent through AIR Kit's verification flows
> - Users control who sees their credentials via MOCA's built-in verification mechanisms
> 
> **The Ideal Future State:**
> - MOCA adds an official API like get user credentials with authentication
> - Only the authenticated user or apps with user consent can call it
> - Returns encrypted credential data from MCSP that only the user can decrypt
> - This would enable building custom wallet UIs showing credentials from all issuers
> - Currently you can only see credentials during verification - this would allow proactive viewing
> - This would enable true cross-issuer credential portability while preserving privacy
> 
> **Issuer Dashboard:**
> - We can also view issued credentials at the AIR Kit Developer Dashboard
> - That's MOCA's official issuer management interface under Issuer Records
> - Shows Holder ID, Credential ID, Claimed Time, and revocation controls
> 
> So we're **not violating privacy** - we're fulfilling our role as an issuer by tracking our own issuances. The encrypted credential data itself remains on decentralized MCSP storage."

**Q: "How do you handle privacy? Can everyone see my salary?"**
> A: "Multi-layer privacy architecture:
> 
> **Current Implementation (Range Buckets):**
> 1. **Backend issuer** sees your exact amount (needed for bucketing decision)
> 2. **Credential stores** only the bucket: Income High which is eight thousand dollars plus per month
> 3. **On-chain storage**: Just the cryptographic hash of the bucket name, not the human-readable text
> 4. **Smart contract** only knows: "This user has INCOME_HIGH credential (180 points)"
> 5. **Public blockchain**: Shows credential hash, not even the bucket name
> 
> So your **exact salary never touches the blockchain**. Only the range bucket.
> 
> **Future: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Phase 4):**
> Using AIR Kit's ZK credential services, we can prove:
> - income greater than five thousand dollars as a yes or no boolean without revealing the exact amount
> - Implemented with **zk-SNARKs**: Generate a cryptographic proof that salary is greater than or equal to the threshold
> - Smart contract verifies proof cryptographically
> - Backend never sees your exact amount (done client-side with ZK circuit)
> 
> **Technical Flow (ZK Future):**
> 1. User inputs their salary in the frontend, say seven thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars
> 2. Frontend generates a ZK proof that the salary is greater than or equal to five thousand dollars, which evaluates to true
> 3. Submit proof to contract, not the salary
> 4. Contract verifies proof using **PLONK/Groth16 verifier**
> 5. Awards points if proof valid
> 
> This is the **holy grail** - prove eligibility without revealing data. AIR Kit's roadmap includes this."
