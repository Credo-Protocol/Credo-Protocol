## 🎬 Act 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

### Screen: Landing Page

**[Open https://credo-protocol.vercel.app]**

### Talking Points:

> "Let me show you the **fundamental inefficiency** in current DeFi lending."
> 
> **[Point to hero section]**
> 
> "Traditional DeFi protocols like Aave require **150% collateral** to borrow $100. Technically, they use a **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 67%** - meaning your collateral value must be 1.5x your borrow amount at all times, or you get liquidated."
> 
> "This exists because **DeFi has no identity layer**. Smart contracts can't verify who you are, what you earn, or if you'll repay. So they require massive over-collateralization as the only risk mitigation."
> 
> **[Scroll to problem section]**
> 
> "Credo Protocol solves this with **on-chain credit scoring using verifiable credentials**. We bridge off-chain identity - your job, income, bank balance - into DeFi through cryptographic proofs. Think FICO scores, but **decentralized, privacy-preserving, and composable**."

**Time Check**: 0:30

---

## 🎬 Act 2: The Journey (2 minutes)

### Part A: Login & Dashboard (20 seconds)

**[Click "Get Started"]**

### Talking Points:

> "First, I'll login with **Moca ID** - this uses AIR Kit's Account Services, which is MOCA's native authentication SDK."
> 
> **[Click "Login with Moca ID" - already connected for demo]**
> 
> "Under the hood, AIR Kit creates a **smart contract wallet** for me - it's an EIP-4337 Account Abstraction wallet. This means I can login with Google, email, or any Web2 method, but I get a non-custodial Ethereum wallet. The private key is managed via **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** - no single point of failure."
> 
> **[Dashboard loads]**
> 
> "Now I'm authenticated on-chain. My wallet address is deterministically derived from my Moca ID. The frontend uses AIR Kit's **EIP-1193 provider** to interact with smart contracts - same interface as MetaMask, but smoother UX."
> 
> **[Point to credit score]**
> 
> "Current credit score: **[YOUR_SCORE]** - that's **[YOUR_TIER]** tier. This is fetched from our **CreditScoreOracle smart contract** via a `getCreditScore(address)` view call. The contract computes this on-chain based on my submitted credentials."

**Time Check**: 0:50

---

### Part B: Score Builder Wizard (40 seconds)

**[Navigate to "Score Builder" tab]**

### Talking Points:

> "This is our **Score Builder Wizard** - it runs the exact same scoring algorithm as our smart contract, but client-side in React."
> 
> **[Select Income Range credential]**
> 
> "Watch the real-time simulation. When I select Income Range..."
> 
> **[Score updates in real-time]**
> 
> "The algorithm calculates: **Base weight (180 points for high income) × Issuer trust score (100%) × Recency factor (100% for new credentials) = 180 points**. Then it adds a **diversity bonus** - 5% per unique credential type I have. My simulated score jumps from **[CURRENT]** to **[SIMULATED]**!"
> 
> **[Point to progress bar]**
> 
> "The progress bar calculates distance to the next tier threshold. Our smart contract has **8 tiers stored on-chain** - from Exceptional (900-1000) down to Very Poor (0-299). Each tier unlocks different collateral ratios."
> 
> **[Select Bank Balance credential]**
> 
> "Add Bank Balance... now **[NEW_SCORE]**. These are **bucketed credentials** - notice the privacy badges. The smart contract only stores `INCOME_HIGH` or `BANK_BALANCE_MEDIUM` as bytes32 hashes, never exact amounts. Privacy-first by design - we use **range proofs** conceptually."

**Time Check**: 1:30

---

### Part C: Request Credential (MOCA Integration) (1 minute 20 seconds)

**[Click "Go to Build Credit →" button]**

### Talking Points:

> "Let me request one of these credentials to show the **deep MOCA integration**."
> 
> **[Click "Request Credential" on Income Range]**
> 
> "Here's where Credo becomes a **true MOCA ecosystem participant** - not just using MOCA for login, but fully integrated with AIR Kit's credential infrastructure."
> 
> **[Modal opens - Step 1: Prepare]**
> 
> "First, our backend prepares the credential. It's generating a **Partner JWT** - that's an RS256-signed JSON Web Token with our official Partner ID, Issuer DID, and Program ID."
> 
> **[Step 1 completes quickly]**
> 
> "The backend also exposes a **JWKS endpoint** at `/.well-known/jwks.json` - this is how MOCA's AIR Kit validates our identity cryptographically. No shared secrets, just public key cryptography."
> 
> **[Step 2: Issue credential - Processing begins]**
> 
> "Now the frontend calls AIR Kit's credential issuance service. Watch what happens..."
> 
> **[While credential is processing - ~40 seconds total]**
> 
> "Behind the scenes - and this is critical - here's the technical flow:
> 
> **Step 1**: AIR Kit validates our Partner JWT by fetching our public key from the JWKS endpoint.
> 
> **Step 2**: AIR Kit signs the credential using **W3C Verifiable Credentials standard** - not our custom signature scheme. This creates a proper JSON-LD credential with cryptographic proof.
> 
> **Step 3**: The credential is stored on **MOCA Chain Storage Providers** - that's MCSP, a decentralized storage network. Not our database, not MOCA's centralized servers. This is the loading we're seeing now.
> 
> **[Point to loading indicator]**
> 
> **Step 4**: The credential gets added to my AIR Kit wallet automatically. If you go to the AIR Kit Dashboard right now at `dashboard.air3.com`, you'd see this credential listed under our Issuer DID.
> 
> **Step 5**: Any MOCA dApp can now discover and verify this credential. It's ecosystem-interoperable, not siloed to Credo."
> 
> **[Credential still processing - fill remaining time]**
> 
> "This is **completely different from Wave 2**. Before, we had mock issuers generating EIP-191 signatures locally. Now:
> - Official **Issuer DIDs** registered in MOCA's registry
> - **MCSP decentralized storage** instead of local
> - **W3C standard compliance** for interoperability
> - **Public schema registry** - other dApps can read our credential definitions
> 
> We've also built in **Paymaster infrastructure** - the code supports gas sponsorship, just needs a policy ID to activate. For this demo, minimal MOCA gas fees."
> 
> **[Credential completes - Success message with MCSP badge appears]**
> 
> "There it is! Notice the **'Stored on MCSP'** badge. That credential is now:
> - ✅ Signed by official AIR Kit
> - ✅ Stored on decentralized infrastructure
> - ✅ Visible in AIR Kit Dashboard
> - ✅ Verifiable by any MOCA dApp
> - ✅ Follows W3C VC standard
> 
> That's **real MOCA Credential Services** - not mock signatures we generated ourselves!"
> 
> **[Click to proceed to blockchain submission]**
> 
> "Now we submit the credential hash to our smart contract on-chain for credit scoring."

**Time Check**: 2:50

---

### Part D: Lending Power (30 seconds)

**[Navigate to "Lending Pool" tab]**

### Talking Points:

> "Now let's see how credit scores unlock better lending terms through **smart contract logic**."
> 
> **[Point to credit score section]**
> 
> "With my **[YOUR_SCORE]** credit score, the smart contract queries the oracle and gets my tier. My tier has a **collateral factor of [COLLATERAL]%** stored on-chain. The LendingPool contract calculates: `borrowLimit = (suppliedCollateral × 100) / collateralFactor`."
> 
> "So I can borrow **$[AMOUNT]** for every $100 I supply. That's **[calculate ratio]x better** than standard DeFi's 0.67x!"
> 
> **[Point to existing position if you have one]**
> 
> "I have an active borrow position. The contract tracks this with **per-user borrow indices** - similar to Compound's interest model. Every time anyone interacts with the contract, it calls `accrueInterest()` which updates the **global borrow index** based on: `newIndex = oldIndex × (1 + (APR × timeElapsed / SECONDS_PER_YEAR))`."
> 
> **[Point to interest display]**
> 
> "My interest accrues continuously. The frontend polls every 5 seconds calling `getBorrowBalanceWithInterest()` - a view function that calculates: `totalOwed = principal × (globalIndex / userIndex)`. No gas costs for this calculation."
> 
> **[Point to APR badge]**
> 
> "My borrowing rate is **[YOUR_APR]%** - tier-based rates are stored in the contract's `tierInterestRates` mapping. Exceptional credit (900+) gets **5% APR**, Very Poor gets **18% APR**. This is retrieved with `getUserAPR(address)` which queries the oracle for your score, then returns the corresponding rate."

**Time Check**: 3:20

---

## 🎬 Act 3: Ecosystem Value (1 minute)

### Part A: Leaderboard (15 seconds)

**[Scroll down to Leaderboard section]**

### Talking Points:

> "Here's our **live leaderboard** - this queries the blockchain for `ScoreComputed` events from the last 10,000 blocks. We're limited to 10k blocks by MOCA's RPC - that's about 8-10 hours of history."
> 
> **[Point to top users]**
> 
> "The frontend uses `ethers.js` to call `oracle.queryFilter('ScoreComputed')` - these are indexed events emitted every time someone submits a credential. Each event contains: user address, base score, component breakdown, diversity bonus, and final score. We aggregate by user, keep the latest score, and sort descending."
> 
> "This demonstrates **network effects** - users compete for rank. But more importantly, it shows **on-chain transparency** - all scoring is auditable via events."

**Time Check**: 3:35

---

### Part B: Composable API (30 seconds)

**[Open new tab to API endpoint]**

**[Navigate to: `https://credo-protocol.vercel.app/api/score/[YOUR_DEMO_ADDRESS]`]**

### Talking Points:

> "Now here's where Credo becomes **composable infrastructure** for the entire ecosystem."
> 
> **[Show JSON response]**
> 
> "This is a Next.js API route at `/api/score/[address].js`. When you hit this endpoint, the backend:
> 1. Creates an **ethers.js JSON-RPC provider** to Moca Chain
> 2. Instantiates our CreditScoreOracle contract with the ABI
> 3. Calls `oracle.getCreditScore(address)` - a view function, no gas
> 4. Calls `oracle.getTierForScore(score)` to get collateral factors
> 5. Caches the result for 60 seconds in memory
> 
> CORS headers are set to `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` - any origin can call this."
> 
> **[Scroll through response]**
> 
> "The response includes score, tier, borrowing power calculations, and **integration code**. Other dApps can:
> - **GameFi**: Call our API to gate content by score
> - **DAOs**: Weight votes by calling `oracle.getCreditScore()` on-chain
> - **DeFi protocols**: Read our oracle for dynamic collateral ratios
> 
> We've also included a **Solidity interface** - `ICreditScoreOracle` with function signatures. Any contract can import this and query our oracle directly without trusting our API."
> 
> **[Point to Solidity example]**
> 
> "See? `oracle.getCreditScore(user)` returns `uint256`. One line of Solidity gives you a user's creditworthiness. That's true composability."

**Time Check**: 4:05

---

### Part C: Testnet Explorer (15 seconds)

**[Open Moca Devnet Explorer in new tab]**

**[Navigate to your Oracle contract: devnet-scan.mocachain.org/address/0x12ad1aBfBde99Ce4D37fB18A5e622A619d59f705]**

### Talking Points:

> "All of this is **deployed and live on Moca Devnet** - Chain ID 5151. These contracts are verified, meaning the source code is publicly readable."
> 
> **[Show contract address]**
> 
> "Here's our CreditScoreOracle at `0x12ad...9f705`. The explorer shows:
> - **Contract bytecode** - the compiled EVM opcodes
> - **Source code** - because we ran `hardhat verify`, the Solidity is published
> - **ABI** - the JSON interface other contracts can use
> - **Read/Write functions** - you can query `getCreditScore()` right from the explorer
> 
> **[Click on 'Contract' tab if visible]**
> 
> "This transparency is critical. Anyone can audit our scoring algorithm, verify the tier configurations, check issuer trust scores. **No black boxes** - everything is on-chain and immutable unless we deploy a new version."

**Time Check**: 4:20

## 🎬 Act 4: Vision & Next Steps (30 seconds)

### Screen: Back to Dashboard or Landing

### Talking Points:

> "So what have we built from a **technical architecture** perspective?
> 
> **For Users**: 
> - **2-3x capital efficiency** - collateral requirements from 150% down to 50%
> - **Privacy-preserving proofs** - range buckets, not exact amounts on-chain
> - **Transparent scoring** - all logic is in smart contracts with event emissions
> 
> **For Developers**:
> - **REST API** with 60s caching and CORS headers - instant integration
> - **Solidity interfaces** - `ICreditScoreOracle` anyone can import
> - **On-chain oracle** - `getCreditScore(address)` view function, zero gas
> - **Standardized events** - `ScoreComputed` with full breakdown for indexing
> 
> **For MOCA Ecosystem**:
> - **Official AIR Kit integration** - Partner JWT authentication with RS256 + JWKS
> - **MCSP decentralized storage** - credentials stored on-chain, not in databases
> - **W3C VC compliance** - JSON-LD credentials with cryptographic proofs
> - **Paymaster-ready** - code supports gas sponsorship via policy ID
> - **Ecosystem interoperability** - any MOCA dApp can discover our credentials
> 
> This is just the beginning. The technical roadmap includes:
> - **Plaid API integration** - real bank balance OAuth instead of simulated data
> - **Zero-knowledge range proofs** via AIR Kit's ZK services - prove income > $X without revealing amount
> - **MOCA Identity Oracle** for cross-chain verification - port your score to Ethereum/Polygon
> - **Liquidation keepers** with Chainlink price feeds - production-grade risk management
> - **EIP-4626 tokenized vaults** - composable yield on supplied collateral
> 
> Credo Protocol brings **TradFi credit concepts to Web3** with **cryptographic guarantees** and **on-chain transparency**. We're making DeFi accessible to **everyone**, not just crypto-wealthy users."
> 
> **[Pause]**
> 
> "Questions?"

**Time Check**: 4:50

## 🔄 Backup Plan

### If Internet Fails:
1. **Use screenshots** - walk through the flow with images
2. **Show code locally** - open project in VS Code
3. **Video backup** - have a pre-recorded 2-min video ready

### If Testnet is Slow:
1. **Mention it** - "Testnet transactions can be slow - let me explain what's happening"
2. **Use previous transactions** - show already-completed ones
3. **Skip to next section** - don't wait more than 20 seconds

### If Contract Errors:
1. **Have a second demo wallet ready** - pre-funded and tested
2. **Show error handling** - "Notice our user-friendly error messages"
3. **Fall back to API** - "Let me show the API instead"

---

## 🎤 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions:

**Q: "How do you verify credentials are real?"**
> A: "Great question! Currently we simulate credentials for demo purposes. In production, the flow would be:
> 
> **Technical Architecture:**
> 1. **Backend integrates with data providers**: Plaid SDK for bank data, Exchange APIs (Coinbase/Binance OAuth), payroll systems (Gusto/ADP)
> 2. **OAuth flow**: User authorizes our backend to fetch their data from the provider
> 3. **Backend validates**: Checks API response signatures, ensures data freshness
> 4. **Credential issuance**: Backend generates Partner JWT, AIR Kit signs with our Issuer DID
> 5. **On-chain submission**: User submits to smart contract
> 
> The smart contract validates the **cryptographic signature** from our Issuer DID - it doesn't know if underlying data is 'real'. That's the **trust layer**: our Issuer DID has a trust score (0-100) stored on-chain. If we issue fake credentials, the community can **deactivate our issuer** via governance, immediately invalidating all our credentials.
> 
> It's like SSL certificates - the contract verifies the signature, users trust the issuer."

**Q: "What prevents Sybil attacks?"**
> A: "Great security question! Multiple layers prevent Sybil attacks:
> 
> **Layer 1: Data Provider KYC**
> - **CEX accounts**: Exchanges require government ID verification (KYC/AML)
> - **Bank accounts**: Plaid connects to banks that require identity verification
> - **Payroll**: Employers verify identity for tax purposes (W-2, SSN)
> 
> **Layer 2: Credential Uniqueness**
> - Smart contract uses `keccak256(credentialData)` as a unique identifier
> - Same credential submitted twice = rejected on-chain
> - Each credential type has a **cooldown period** (e.g., can't submit new income proof every day)
> 
> **Layer 3: Issuer Accountability**
> - Our Issuer DID is registered on-chain with a trust score
> - If we issue fraudulent credentials, we can be **deactivated via governance**
> - All our issued credentials would be invalidated instantly
> 
> **Layer 4: Economic Incentives**
> - Creating fake Coinbase accounts is expensive (KYC services charge)
> - Credential recency decay means old credentials lose value over time
> - Cost of Sybil attack > benefit gained from slightly better rates
> 
> You can't easily create 100 fake identities - each requires real KYC'd accounts."

**Q: "How is this better than just using tokenbound accounts or on-chain history?"**
> A: "On-chain activity only shows what you've done with crypto. Credo bridges **off-chain identity** - your job, bank balance, salary - things that matter in traditional credit. Most people have more financial history off-chain than on-chain. We're bringing that into DeFi."

**Q: "What happens if someone defaults? No liquidation mechanism shown."**
> A: "Correct - this is a **testnet demonstration**, not mainnet-ready. The technical architecture for production would require:
> 
> **Liquidation Mechanism (Phase 2):**
> 1. **Price Oracles**: Integrate Chainlink price feeds for USDC/collateral valuation
> 2. **Health Factor Monitoring**: `healthFactor = (collateralValue × liquidationThreshold) / totalDebt`
> 3. **Liquidator Incentives**: When healthFactor < 1.0, anyone can liquidate for 5-10% bonus
> 4. **Partial Liquidations**: Only liquidate enough to restore health, not entire position
> 
> **Additional Safety Mechanisms:**
> 1. **Interest Rate Model**: Utilization-based rates (like Aave) to discourage 100% borrowing
> 2. **Borrow Caps**: Per-user limits based on credit tier (e.g., Exceptional tier: max $50k)
> 3. **Protocol Insurance Fund**: 10% of interest revenue goes to insurance pool
> 4. **Keeper Network**: Off-chain bots monitor positions, call liquidate() when needed
> 
> **Credit-Specific Features:**
> 1. **Grace Periods**: Higher credit scores get 24-48 hour grace before liquidation
> 2. **Score Penalties**: Liquidated users lose 50-100 credit points (social cost)
> 3. **Repayment Plans**: Option to restructure debt before liquidation for good credit
> 
> This buildathon focused on **proving the credential infrastructure works** - getting 10 W3C credentials from AIR Kit into our smart contract. Liquidation logic is standard DeFi - we can add it once the identity layer is validated."

**Q: "Can users game the system by requesting the same credential multiple times?"**
> A: "No - the smart contract uses `credentialHash` as a unique identifier. Same credential twice = rejected. Also, credentials **decay over time** (70-100% weight based on age), so old credentials become less valuable. Users are incentivized to update with fresh credentials."

**Q: "Why Moca Chain? Why not Ethereum?"**
> A: "MOCA provides **vertical integration** for decentralized identity that would take months to build on Ethereum. Here's the technical comparison:
> 
> **On Ethereum, we'd need to:**
> 1. Build our own **Issuer DID registry** (custom smart contract)
> 2. Implement **W3C VC signing** logic ourselves
> 3. Set up **IPFS/Arweave** for decentralized storage
> 4. Build **EIP-4337 bundler** infrastructure for account abstraction
> 5. Create **paymaster contracts** and fund them manually
> 6. Build credential verification logic from scratch
> 
> **On MOCA, we get:**
> 1. **AIR Kit Dashboard** - register Issuer DIDs in UI, instant
> 2. **Partner JWT + JWKS** - proven auth pattern with `airService.issueCredential()`
> 3. **MCSP built-in** - decentralized storage handled automatically
> 4. **AIR Kit wallets** - EIP-4337 AA wallets with MPC key management
> 5. **Paymaster infrastructure** - just add policy ID, no custom contracts
> 6. **Schema registry** - W3C VC templates already deployed
> 
> **Time Saved**: ~3-4 months of infrastructure work → 2 weeks integration
> 
> **Strategic Fit**: Moca's gaming/entertainment ecosystem aligns perfectly. Gamers have:
> - Exchange accounts (high trading volume)
> - On-chain NFT/token activity
> - Social reputation (Discord, Twitter)
> - But no traditional credit history
> 
> They're **credit-invisible** to TradFi banks but **credit-visible** to our on-chain scoring. Perfect initial market."

**Q: "How do you handle privacy? Can everyone see my salary?"**
> A: "Multi-layer privacy architecture:
> 
> **Current Implementation (Range Buckets):**
> 1. **Backend issuer** sees your exact amount (needed for bucketing decision)
> 2. **Credential stores** only the bucket: `INCOME_HIGH` ($8k+/month)
> 3. **On-chain storage**: Just bytes32 hash `keccak256('INCOME_HIGH')` = `0x1a2b...`
> 4. **Smart contract** only knows: "This user has INCOME_HIGH credential (180 points)"
> 5. **Public blockchain**: Shows credential hash, not even the bucket name
> 
> So your **exact salary never touches the blockchain**. Only the range bucket.
> 
> **Future: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (Phase 4):**
> Using AIR Kit's ZK credential services, we can prove:
> - `income > $5000` (boolean) without revealing amount
> - Implemented with **zk-SNARKs**: Generate proof that `salary ≥ threshold`
> - Smart contract verifies proof cryptographically
> - Backend never sees your exact amount (done client-side with ZK circuit)
> 
> **Technical Flow (ZK Future):**
> 1. User inputs salary in frontend: `$7,234`
> 2. Frontend generates ZK proof: `PROOF[salary ≥ $5000] = true`
> 3. Submit proof to contract, not the salary
> 4. Contract verifies proof using **PLONK/Groth16 verifier**
> 5. Awards points if proof valid
> 
> This is the **holy grail** - prove eligibility without revealing data. AIR Kit's roadmap includes this."
