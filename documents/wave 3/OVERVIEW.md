# Credo Protocol - Wave 3 Implementation Plan

**Timeline**: Oct 25-27, 2025 (3 days)  
**Status**: Ready for Execution  
**Objective**: Transform MVP into production-ready protocol with advanced credentials, clear user journey, and demonstrated path to adoption

---

## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

### Wave 2 Feedback Analysis

**What Reviewers Want:**

1. **laishaw**: "More advanced credentials for loans" + "More defined user journey for earning a higher score"
2. **0xmythril**: "How to get adoption and liquidity"
3. **patrickmoca**: "Work on CreditScore Oracle with goal of deploying to Moca chain testnet"
4. **tonyfung**: Praised "Solid integration & e2e flows" (maintain this quality)

### Wave 3 Response Strategy

Prove that Credo is **production-ready** with:
- âœ… Real credential depth (bucketed privacy-preserving credentials)
- âœ… Crystal-clear UX showing "how to earn better rates"
- âœ… Composable credit primitive (other dApps can use our scores)
- âœ… Testnet deployment proving production readiness

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

By end of Wave 3, judges should be able to:

âœ… **Try 2 new advanced credentials** (Income Range, Bank Balance Average)  
âœ… **See exactly what unlocks the next tier** (Score Builder Wizard)  
âœ… **Watch interest accrue** in real-time on borrowed positions  
âœ… **Access a public API** to pull any user's credit score (composability)  
âœ… **Use the protocol on Moca testnet** (production-ready signal)  
âœ… **Understand the adoption path** via leaderboard and partnerships

---

## ðŸ“‚ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Oracle v2 Foundation (Day 1 - Oct 25)
**Duration**: 6-8 hours  
**Document**: [PHASE1-ORACLE.md](./PHASE1-ORACLE.md)

- On-chain registries (issuers, credential types, tiers)
- Score breakdown events for transparency
- Safety improvements (reentrancy guard, gas bounds)
- Complete testing suite

**Why First**: All other features depend on Oracle's new capabilities.

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Credentials System (Day 2 AM - Oct 26)
**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Document**: [PHASE2-CREDENTIALS.md](./PHASE2-CREDENTIALS.md)

- Income Range buckets (privacy-preserving)
- Bank Balance 30-day average buckets
- Backend issuer upgrades
- API endpoints for new credentials

**Why Second**: Addresses "more advanced credentials" feedback directly.

---

### Phase 3: LendingPool v2 + UX Enhancements (Day 2 PM - Day 3 AM)
**Duration**: 8-10 hours  
**Document**: [PHASE3-LENDING-UX.md](./PHASE3-LENDING-UX.md)

- Interest accrual system (5-18% APR by tier)
- Score Builder Wizard (simulation + tier gaps)
- Real-time interest display
- Clear "path to next tier" UX

**Why Third**: Requires Oracle v2 and advanced credentials to be complete.

---

### Phase 4: Testnet Deployment & Ecosystem (Day 3 PM - Oct 27)
**Duration**: 6-8 hours  
**Document**: [PHASE4-DEPLOYMENT.md](./PHASE4-DEPLOYMENT.md)

- Deploy to Moca testnet
- Composable score API (`/api/score/:address`)
- Leaderboard for adoption proof
- Production monitoring

**Why Fourth**: Deploy after all features are tested locally.

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Demo Prep (Day 3 Evening)
**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Document**: [PHASE5-DOCS-DEMO.md](./PHASE5-DOCS-DEMO.md)

- Update README with Wave 3 features
- Create 4-minute demo script
- Integration guide for other dApps
- Complete testing checklist

**Why Last**: Polish and preparation after everything works.

## ðŸ“Š Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Oracle v2)
    â†“ MUST COMPLETE FIRST
Phase 2 (Advanced Credentials)
