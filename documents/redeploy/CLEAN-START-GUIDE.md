# üöÄ Complete Clean Start Guide - Credo Protocol

This guide will help you redeploy all contracts and test the complete MOCA integration.

**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025 (Verified & Tested)

---

## üìã Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] MOCA Devnet tokens in your wallet
- [ ] AIR Kit Dashboard setup complete (Phase 5.1)
- [ ] All 10 schemas created
- [ ] All 10 issuance programs created
- [ ] Partner Secret generated
- [ ] RSA keys generated (`backend/private.key` & `backend/public.key`)
- [ ] ngrok running (for JWKS URL)

---

## Step 1: Clean Existing Data

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd Credo-Protocol

# Optional: Clear any existing deployed addresses
# (We'll generate new ones)
echo "Backing up old deployment..."
cp contracts/deployed-addresses.json contracts/deployed-addresses.backup.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

---

## Step 2: Redeploy Smart Contracts

```bash
# Navigate to contracts directory
cd contracts

# Check your wallet has MOCA tokens
echo "Check balance at: https://devnet-scan.mocachain.org/faucet"

# Deploy contracts (use the correct script name)
npm run deploy:devnet

# This will:
# ‚úÖ Deploy CreditScoreOracle v2
# ‚úÖ Deploy LendingPool (with interest accrual)
# ‚úÖ Deploy MockUSDC
# ‚úÖ Register 11 credential types (all 10 types + on-chain activity)
# ‚úÖ Enable USDC in lending pool
# ‚úÖ Save addresses to deployed-addresses.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üéâ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!
üìã Contract Addresses:
   CreditScoreOracle: 0x12ad1aBfBde99Ce4D37fB18A5e622A619d59f705 (your addresses will vary)
   LendingPool:       0x3c30Cd9c071B9ee307C251a3e120DA6e8dde7bd4
   MockUSDC:          0xDBa63296abD241Ed9d485F890C63975452f1CD47
```

**IMPORTANT:** Copy these addresses - you'll need them for Step 3!

**Latest Successful Deployment:** October 27, 2025 at 4:15 AM UTC

### 2.1 ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Register Issuers

**This step is REQUIRED after every deployment!**

```bash
# Still in contracts directory
npx hardhat run --network moca-devnet scripts/register-deployer-issuer.ts
```

**Why this is needed**: 
- Without registered issuers, credential submissions fail with "missing revert data" error
- This registers your deployer address + all mock issuers on the Oracle contract
- Must be done EVERY time you deploy new contracts
- The script automatically reads the new Oracle address from `deployed-addresses.json`

**Expected Output:**
```
üîê Registering Deployer as Issuer
============================================================
üìç Oracle Address: 0x<YOUR_NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS>
üë§ Deployer Address: 0x32F91E4E2c60A9C16cAE736D3b42152B331c147F

‚öôÔ∏è  Registering deployer as issuer...
‚úÖ Deployer registered successfully!

‚öôÔ∏è  Registering mock issuers on correct contract...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Mock Exchange already registered (or ‚úÖ registered if first time)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Mock Employer already registered
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Mock Bank already registered

============================================================
‚úÖ All issuers registered on correct contract!
```

**Note:** If you see "already registered", that's fine - it means the deploy script registered them.

---

## Step 3: Update All Environment Variables

### 3.1 Update Frontend `.env.local`

**Get addresses from:** `contracts/deployed-addresses.json`

```bash
cd Credo-Protocol
# View the deployed addresses
cat contracts/deployed-addresses.json
```

Now open `.env.local` and update **6 address variables** (3 primary + 3 legacy):

```bash
# Primary contract addresses (UPDATE THESE!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_ORACLE_ADDRESS=0x<YOUR_NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS>
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS=0x<YOUR_NEW_POOL_ADDRESS>
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_USDC_ADDRESS=0x<YOUR_NEW_USDC_ADDRESS>

# Legacy names for backward compatibility (UPDATE THESE TOO!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_SCORE_ORACLE=0x<YOUR_NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS>
NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL=0x<YOUR_NEW_POOL_ADDRESS>
NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC=0x<YOUR_NEW_USDC_ADDRESS>

# Keep these from Phase 5.1-5.3 (DON'T CHANGE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARTNER_ID=954fe820-050d-49fb-b22e-884922aa6cef
NEXT_PUBLIC_ISSUER_DID=did:air:id:test:4P3gyKQFs7SYu1XBDirLU7WhJqRgDHHuKbfVuGTwun
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERIFIER_DID=did:key:81eGFbL7uQGFjvbTMAyQv4XtzTv7w7JLpevwLDRtenKt6i4z8sgsuAPwGJaXrBBZUgRbfFC13mXE2QVMDffs1KScqF
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMASTER_POLICY_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCA_RPC=https://devnet-rpc.mocachain.org
```

### 3.2 Update `lib/contracts.js` (fallback addresses)

Open `lib/contracts.js` and update the fallback addresses in the CONTRACTS object:

```javascript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  CREDIT_ORACLE: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_ORACLE_ADDRESS || '0x<YOUR_NEW_ORACLE_ADDRESS>',
  LENDING_POOL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS || '0x<YOUR_NEW_POOL_ADDRESS>',
  MOCK_USDC: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_USDC_ADDRESS || '0x<YOUR_NEW_USDC_ADDRESS>',
};
```

**Why update fallbacks?** If `.env.local` is missing, the app will still work with these addresses.

### 3.3 Update `backend/.env` (‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FOR REWARDS!)

Open `backend/.env` and update the USDC contract address:

```bash
# Update USDC contract address for verification faucet
USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x<YOUR_NEW_USDC_ADDRESS>
```

**Why this is CRITICAL:**
- The $50 USDC verification reward uses this address
- Without updating, users won't receive rewards after verification
- The transaction will fail silently with the old address

**Where to find this in backend/.env:**
- Search for `USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (around line 101)
- Replace with the new MockUSDC address from `deployed-addresses.json`

---

## Step 4: Restart All Services

### 4.1 Restart Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Start backend
npm run dev

# Verify it's running
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "integration": {
    "partnerId": "954fe820...",
    "issuerDid": "did:air:id:test:...",
    "features": ["Partner JWT Generation", "Official AIR Kit Credentials", ...]
  },
  "credentials": {
    "total": 10
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Restart Frontend

```bash
cd Credo-Protocol

# Kill existing Next.js process
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true

# Start frontend
npm run dev

# Visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### 4.3 Verify ngrok (JWKS URL)

```bash
# Check ngrok is running
curl http://localhost:4040/api/tunnels

# Verify JWKS is accessible
curl https://YOUR_NGROK_URL/.well-known/jwks.json
```

## üìù Quick Reference Commands

**Redeploy Everything:**
```bash
# 1. Deploy contracts
cd contracts && npm run deploy:devnet

# 2. Register issuers
npx hardhat run --network moca-devnet scripts/register-deployer-issuer.ts

# 3. Copy addresses from deployed-addresses.json
cat deployed-addresses.json

# 4. Update .env.local (6 variables) and lib/contracts.js (3 fallbacks)

# 5. Restart backend
cd Credo-Protocol/backend
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
npm run dev

# 6. Restart frontend (new terminal)
cd Credo-Protocol
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true
npm run dev
```

**Files to Update After Redeployment:**
1. `Credo-Protocol/.env.local` (6 variables)
2. `Credo-Protocol/lib/contracts.js` (3 fallback addresses)
3. **`Credo-Protocol/backend/.env` (1 variable: USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS)** ‚Üê CRITICAL FOR REWARDS
4. `Credo-Protocol/contracts/scripts/register-deployer-issuer.ts` (only if it has hardcoded address)

**Important Addresses to Update:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_ORACLE_ADDRESS` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREDIT_SCORE_ORACLE`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL_ADDRESS` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_LENDING_POOL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_USDC_ADDRESS` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_USDC`
- **`USDC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` (backend/.env)** ‚Üê CRITICAL FOR REWARDS
