# Credential Revocation & App Restructure

## Summary

The application has been completely restructured with proper credential lifecycle management and a cleaner, more organized user flow.

## What Changed

### 1. Backend: Credential Tracking System ✅

**New File:** `backend/src/utils/credentialStore.js`
- In-memory credential database (replace with DB in production)
- Tracks all issued credentials with status: `active`, `expired`, `revoked`
- Automatic expiry detection based on expirationDate
- Revocation management with reasons

**New API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/credentials/track` - Track newly issued credentials
- `GET /api/credentials/user/:address` - Get user credentials with status
- `POST /api/credentials/revoke` - Revoke a credential
- `GET /api/credentials/stats` - Platform-wide statistics

### 2. Frontend: Updated Credential Services ✅

**Updated:** `lib/credentialServices.js`
- `getUserCredentials()` now fetches from backend (real data!)
- `issueCredential()` automatically tracks credentials after issuance
- `getCredentialDisplayInfo()` shows expiry, revocation, and status
- Enhanced validity checking with detailed status

### 3. New Page Structure ✅

**Old:** Single `/dashboard` page with tabs
**New:** Dedicated pages for each feature:

```
/dashboard       → Overview with stats and quick links
/credentials     → Credential wallet & marketplace
/lending         → Lending pool interface
/score           → Credit score builder & leaderboard
```

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner URLs (shareable links to specific sections)
- Better SEO and navigation
- Faster page loads (code splitting)
- More focused user experience

### 4. Shared Navigation Component ✅

**New File:** `components/layout/AppNav.jsx`
- Consistent header across all app pages
- Active page highlighting
- Mobile-responsive navigation
- Quick access to all sections

### 5. Enhanced Credential Wallet ✅

**Updated:** `components/CredentialWallet.jsx`
- Shows credential status with colored badges:
  - 🟢 **Active** - Credential is valid
  - 🟡 **Expiring Soon** - Less than 30 days remaining
  - 🟠 **Expired** - Past expiration date
  - 🔴 **Revoked** - Issuer has revoked
- Displays expiry dates and time remaining
- Shows revocation reasons
- Visual warnings for expired/revoked credentials

### 6. Notification System ✅

**New File:** `components/CredentialNotifications.jsx`
- Real-time alerts for credential issues:
  - **Revoked credentials** - Immediate notification
  - **Expired credentials** - Renew prompt
  - **Expiring soon** - 30-day warning
- Dismissible notifications
- Auto-refresh every 5 minutes
- Action buttons to fix issues

## Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Robust expiry processes** - Automatic detection and warnings
✅ **Revocation management** - Backend tracking with reasons
✅ **Holder notification** - Real-time alerts for status changes
✅ **Thorough validation** - Credentials tracked before and after issuance
✅ **User sovereignty** - Clear status visibility and control

## How It Works

### Credential Lifecycle

```
1. User requests credential
   ↓
2. Backend prepares credential (generates JWT, signature, etc.)
   ↓
3. Frontend issues via AIR Kit (stored on MCSP)
   ↓
4. Backend tracks credential (POST /api/credentials/track)
   ↓
5. Credential appears in wallet with "Active" status
   ↓
6. Auto-check expiry daily
   ↓
7. Show warnings 30 days before expiry
   ↓
8. Mark as "Expired" after expiration date
   OR
   Mark as "Revoked" if issuer revokes
```

### User Flow

```
Landing Page (/)
     ↓
Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Overview of credit score
  - Quick stats
  - Links to all sections
     ↓
Credentials (/credentials)
  - Tab 1: My Wallet → View all credentials with status
  - Tab 2: Get Credentials → Request new ones
     ↓
Lending (/lending)
  - Supply USDC
  - Borrow with credit score
     ↓
Score Builder (/score)
  - Simulate credential combinations
  - View leaderboard
```

## Migration from Old Dashboard

**Old Structure:**
```
dashboard.js
  ├─ Score Builder (tab)
  ├─ Build Credit (tab)
  └─ Lending Pool (tab)
```

**New Structure:**
```
dashboard.js       → Overview page
credentials.js     → Build Credit + Wallet
lending.js         → Lending Pool
score.js           → Score Builder + Leaderboard
```

**What Happened:**
- Old dashboard backed up to `dashboard.old.js`
- New simplified dashboard activated
- All functionality preserved, just reorganized

## Testing the New System

### 1. Test Credential Tracking
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
npm start

# Issue a credential in the app
# Check backend logs for tracking confirmation:
# "📝 Tracked credential: BANK_BALANCE_HIGH for 0x..."
```

### 2. Test Credential Display
1. Go to `/credentials`
2. Click "My Wallet" tab
3. You should see:
   - All your credentials
   - Status badges (Active/Expired/Revoked)
   - Expiry dates and time remaining
   - Storage confirmation (MCSP)

### 3. Test Notifications
1. Navigate to any app page
2. If you have expiring/expired/revoked credentials:
   - Notification appears in top-right corner
   - Click "View Details" or "Renew Credential"
   - Dismiss with X button

### 4. Test Revocation (Backend)
```bash
# Using curl or Postman:
POST http://localhost:3001/api/credentials/revoke
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "credentialId": "PROGRAM_ID_HERE",
  "reason": "Testing revocation system"
}

# Credential will show as "Revoked" in wallet
# User will see notification
```

### 5. Test Navigation
1. Start at `/dashboard`
2. Click through all nav links
3. Verify:
   - Active page is highlighted
   - All pages load correctly
   - Mobile navigation works

## Future Enhancements

### Production Considerations

1. **Database Integration**
   - Replace in-memory store with PostgreSQL/MongoDB
   - Add credential indexing for fast queries
   - Implement backup and recovery

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connection for instant revocation alerts
   - Push notifications for mobile
   - Email alerts for critical events

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Issuer portal for credential management
   - Bulk revocation tools
   - Analytics and reporting

4. **Enhanced Security**
   - Authentication for revocation endpoint
   - Rate limiting on API calls
   - Audit logging for all credential operations

5. **AIR Kit Integration**
   - Direct API to check revocation status on AIR Kit Dashboard
   - Sync local tracking with AIR Kit state
   - Automated renewal prompts

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Credentials not showing in wallet?**
A: Check backend logs for tracking confirmation. Ensure backend is running.

**Q: Notifications not appearing?**
A: Credentials must have status `expired`, `revoked`, or expiring within 30 days.

**Q: Navigation broken?**
A: Make sure all page files exist and AppNav is imported correctly.

**Q: Old dashboard still showing?**
A: Clear browser cache or do hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R).

## Conclusion

Your app now has:
- ✅ Professional page structure
- ✅ Complete credential lifecycle management
- ✅ Best-in-class revocation handling
- ✅ User-friendly notifications
- ✅ Better organization and UX

The messy single-page dashboard is now split into focused, purpose-built pages that are easier to navigate and maintain! 🎉
